The precited score monte carlo, likely a team will score under 2 goals or over 4EditLet me analyze this NHL game between Utah and Montreal by looking at their recent performance patterns and scoring trends.
NHL Game Scoring AnalysisClick to open code
Based on the analysis:

Utah's scoring patterns:


Averages 2.59 goals per game
Scores under 2 goals in 36.4% of games
Scores over 4 goals in 22.7% of games
Recent form shows lower scoring (1.6 goals in last 5 games)


Montreal's scoring patterns:


Averages 2.75 goals per game
Scores under 2 goals in 25% of games
Scores over 4 goals in 20% of games
Recent form shows average scoring (2.2 goals in last 5 games)

Given these patterns, there is indeed a significant probability that at least one team will score either under 2 or over 4 goals. The data supports this prediction because:

Both teams have high volatility in scoring
Utah especially has been trending toward lower scores recently
Montreal has shown capability for both high-scoring outbursts and low-scoring games

The most likely scenario appears to be Utah scoring under 2 goals, given their recent form and higher frequency of low-scoring games. Montreal's scoring is more evenly distributed but still shows similar patterns of extremes.


Bpredict scoreEditBased on the recent trends and scoring patterns, here's my predicted score analysis:
Utah:

Averaging only 1.6 goals in last 5 games
On the road (slightly lower scoring typically)
Has been shut out 3 times in last 10 games
Vejmelka likely in net (has been their primary goalie)

Montreal:

Averaging 2.2 goals in last 5 games
Playing at home (tend to score more)
Montembeault likely starting (their consistent starter)
Have scored 2+ goals in 7 of last 10 games

Predicted Score:
Montreal 3, Utah 1
Reasoning:

Utah's recent offensive struggles
Montreal's home ice advantage
Both teams' goalies have been solid when rested
Montreal has been more consistent in scoring
Utah trending under on totals recently

The model suggests Montreal should be able to generate enough offense at home while limiting Utah's struggling offense.


Meta

Based on the data, recent form, and some randomness, here's a simulated score:
