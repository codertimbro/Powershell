#### **Trends and Patterns**
1. **Scoring Trends:**

     - Games under 2 goals: 4 times in the last 10 games.
     - Games over 5 goals: 4 times in the last 10 games.
     - Recent form is inconsistent, with strong possession metrics not always translating into goals.  
   - **Vegas:**
     - Games under 2 goals: 3 times in the last 10 games.
     - Games over 5 goals: 5 times in the last 10 games.
     - Tend to capitalize on lower shot volumes with high efficiency.  

2. **Advanced Metrics:**
   - **CF% (Corsi):**
     - Dallas has a consistent edge in puck control, often exceeding 55% in CF%.  
     - Vegas fluctuates but performs well in games with lower opponent possession (e.g., Anaheim).  
   - **oZS% (Offensive Zone Starts):**
     - Dallas has strong offensive starts, favoring their scoring potential.  
     - Vegas is more balanced but leans defensive in recent matchups.  

3. **Key Points of Focus:**
   - **Dallas:** Poor PDO in the last game suggests a rebound in shooting percentage and save percentage is likely.  
   - **Vegas:** Strong goaltending (I. Samsonov and A. Hill) has consistently supported their winning outcomes.  

4. **Player Contributions:**
   - **Dallas:**  
     - Top assist trends: J. Robertson, often involved in multi-point games, performs well after losses.  
     - Under assists: M. Duchene, limited offensive production recently.  
   - **Vegas:**  
     - Over points: J. Eichel, strong scorer in home games with multiple high-impact performances.  
     - Under assists: Defense tends to contribute less offensively.

#### **Projection**
- **Score Prediction:**  
  **DAL 3 – VGK 4**  
  - Expect a close, high-scoring game based on offensive rebounds and efficiency trends.  

- **Over/Under:** **Over 6 Goals**

- **ATS:** **Take VGK (-121)**  
  - Vegas has shown a strong home edge and consistency against teams with high CF% but low PDO, as with DAL.

#### **Key Points for Analysis**
1. **Shooting Efficiency:**  
   - Dallas needs to improve shot quality, given low PDO in the last game.  
   - Vegas should maintain high-efficiency trends.  

2. **Possession Battle:**  
   - Dallas may control the puck, but Vegas thrives on counterattacks and efficient conversions.  

3. **Goaltending Matchup:**  
   - If **J. Oettinger** starts for DAL, expect a bounce-back game.  
   - **I. Samsonov** or **A. Hill** for VGK should provide solid defense but may allow rebounds under pressure.
