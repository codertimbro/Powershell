I'll break down optimal unit sizing based on confidence levels, considering multiple factors that affect reliability:

1. Highest Confidence Level (3-4 Units) - 75%+ Hit Rate
When these factors combine:
- 4+ positive correlating trends align
- No significant contradicting factors
- Starting goalies confirmed
- Historical sample size > 50 games

Specific Scenarios:
- Home favorite + rested goalie + opponent back-to-back + line movement agrees
- Division game + post-January + consistent goalie + strong historical trend
- Multiple travel/rest advantages + clear weather + strong historical pattern

2. Strong Confidence (2-3 Units) - 70-74% Hit Rate
When these align:
- 3 positive correlating trends
- Minor contradicting factors acceptable
- Sample size > 30 games

Scenarios:
- Home/Away pattern + goalie trend + opponent fatigue
- Line movement + time of day + weather factor
- Rest advantage + opponent travel + historical success

3. Moderate Confidence (1-2 Units) - 65-69% Hit Rate
When having:
- 2 positive correlating trends
- Some uncertainty in variables
- Sample size > 20 games

4. Minimum Unit (1 Unit) - 60-64% Hit Rate
When seeing:
- Single strong trend
- Multiple uncertain variables
- Limited sample size

Risk Management Rules:
1. Never exceed 4 units regardless of confidence
2. Reduce unit size by 50% if:
   - Key player questionable
   - Significant line movement against trend
   - Unusual external factors

3. Unit Adjustment Factors:
- Increase by 0.5 units when:
   * Additional confirming trends emerge
   * Line moves in predicted direction
   * Key statistics support prediction

- Decrease by 0.5 units when:
   * Contradicting trends appear
   * Unexpected line movement
   * Key player status uncertain

4. Bankroll Management:
- 1 unit = 1-2% of total bankroll
- Maximum daily risk: 8-10% of bankroll
- Maximum weekly risk: 20-25% of bankroll

5. Confidence Level Modifiers:
High Confidence (+0.5 units) when:
- Multiple systems align
- Clear rest advantage
- Strong historical precedent
- Favorable weather conditions

Reduce Confidence (-0.5 units) when:
- Conflicting trends
- Uncertain goalie status
- Significant injuries
- Unusual schedule spots

Sample Unit Size Decision Tree:

3-4 Units:
- Home favorite (-150 or better)
- Rested goalie confirmed
- Opponent on back-to-back
- Line moving in our direction
- Clear weather
- Strong historical trend (75%+)

2-3 Units:
- Two team trends align
- One scheduling advantage
- Moderate sample size
- No major contradictions

1-2 Units:
- Single strong trend
- Some uncertain variables
- Limited historical data

Would you like me to:
1. Break down specific scenarios in more detail?
2. Create a detailed unit sizing calculator?
3. Analyze bankroll management strategies?
4. Look at variance and drawdown management?
