Let me break down the home/away splits for both teams.

Colorado:
Home Games (10):
- Record: 5-5
- Average Goals For: 3.3
- Average Goals Against: 3.6
- O/U Record: 6-3-1
- ATS Record: 4-6

Away Games (15):
- Record: 7-8
- Average Goals For: 3.0
- Average Goals Against: 3.9
- O/U Record: 7-7-1
- ATS Record: 7-8

Buffalo:
Home Games (13):
- Record: 5-8
- Average Goals For: 3.2
- Average Goals Against: 3.5
- O/U Record: 7-5-1
- ATS Record: 5-8

Away Games (12):
- Record: 4-8
- Average Goals For: 2.7
- Average Goals Against: 3.3
- O/U Record: 4-7-1
- ATS Record: 4-8

Key Insights:
1. Colorado performs slightly better on the road than at home this season, especially ATS
2. Buffalo struggles both home and away, but scores more at home (3.2 vs 2.7 goals)
3. Both teams see more OVERS in home games
4. Colorado allows more goals on the road (3.9) than at home (3.6)

Since this game is in Buffalo:
- Buffalo's home scoring average (3.2) vs Colorado's road defense (3.9 against) suggests potential for Buffalo goals
- However, Buffalo's recent form shows scoring struggles
- Colorado's road games tend to be higher scoring overall

This analysis slightly adjusts my previous recommendation - while recent form suggests UNDER, the home/away splits actually point more toward an OVER, especially with Colorado's defensive issues on the road. The game being in Buffalo could lead to more scoring than their recent games suggest.

Let me analyze the data for both Colorado (CAL) and Buffalo (BUF) to help identify betting trends and patterns.

Based on the data analysis, here are the key insights:

1. Scoring Patterns:
- Colorado scores under 2 goals in 16% of games
- Colorado scores over 4 goals in 16% of games
- Buffalo scores under 2 goals in 24% of games
- Buffalo scores over 4 goals in 20% of games

2. Over/Under Trends:
- Colorado's recent games have trended UNDER (4 of last 5 under)
- Buffalo's recent games have also trended UNDER (3 of last 4 under)
- Both teams have been involved in lower-scoring games lately

3. ATS (Against The Spread) Trends:
- Colorado is 2-3 in their last 5 ATS
- Buffalo is 1-4 in their last 5 ATS
- Both teams have struggled against the spread recently

4. Notable Patterns:
- Buffalo has been inconsistent offensively, alternating between high and low scoring games
- Colorado has been more defensively focused recently, with tighter games

Betting Recommendation:
Given the recent trends and data, the UNDER looks like the stronger play. Both teams have been trending under recently, and their defensive metrics have been improving. The game total would likely be set around 6 or 6.5 goals based on recent lines.

For ATS, neither team has been reliable recently, making it a riskier bet. If forced to choose, the home team (Buffalo) as an underdog might offer better value given Colorado's recent road performance.

Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect of these trends in more detail?
