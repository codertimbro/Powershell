- More consistent scoring on the road than at home

2. Montreal:
- Has gone OVER in 3 straight games
- Struggling defensively (allowed 4+ goals in 4 of last 5)
- Poor road record but decent scoring away from home

Betting Recommendation:
1. The OVER looks promising here given:
   - Montreal's recent defensive struggles
   - Both teams trending OVER lately
   - Islanders score more on road
   - Montreal gives up more goals at home

2. Islanders ATS looks like the better play because:
   - Montreal's poor recent form
   - Islanders' better road scoring average
   - Montreal's defensive struggles

The strongest play appears to be OVER first, with Islanders ATS as a secondary play, given the recent scoring trends and Montreal's defensive issues.
