# Seattle Kraken Analysis

- Over 4 goals: 4/24 games (16.7%)
- Shutouts: 3 games

## Betting Trends
- ATS Record: 9-15
- Over/Under Record: 11-13
- Home Record: 5-7
- Away Record: 4-8

Key Trend: Strong "under" tendency in recent games (6 of last 8 games went under)

# Carolina Hurricanes Analysis

## Scoring Patterns

Based on this analysis, here are the best betting opportunities:

1. Carolina Home Games: The Hurricanes have been extremely strong at home (9-3) and have covered the spread consistently. Their home games would be the strongest bet opportunity.

2. Seattle Team Total Unders: The Kraken have gone under 2 goals in 33.3% of their games, and their recent scoring trend has been particularly low. When they're facing strong defensive teams, the under on their team total could be valuable.

3. Carolina Team Total Overs: The Hurricanes have shown consistent offensive production, going over 4 goals in nearly 30% of their games. They rarely score under 2 goals (only 12.5% of games).

Key Trends to Watch:
- Seattle has been much weaker on the road
- Carolina has been covering spreads at an impressive rate (16-8 ATS)
- Seattle games have trended under recently
- Carolina's home ice advantage is significant

Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect of these trends in more detail?
