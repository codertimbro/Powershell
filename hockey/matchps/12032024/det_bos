## Betting Trends
- ATS Record: 12-12

Best Betting Opportunities:

1. Under Bets:
- Both teams have strong under tendencies
- Detroit particularly good for unders (9-15 O/U record)
- Boston games go under 62.5% of the time

2. Team Total Opportunities:
- Detroit scoring 1 or less: Good value when facing top goaltenders (25% frequency)
- Boston scoring 4+: Good opportunity when home favorite (22.2% frequency)

3. Specific Patterns:
- Detroit is more likely to go under on road games
- Boston shows strong variance between high/low scoring games
- Both teams have shown recent scoring volatility

Key Additional Insights:
1. Boston's recent scoring burst likely due for regression
2. Detroit performs better as underdog ATS
3. Both teams have relatively poor road records
4. Games involving either team tend to stay under more often than not

Based on the data and recent trends, here's my projection for Detroit @ Boston:

Key Factors:
1. Detroit scoring pattern:
- Away games: Averaging 2.46 goals/game
- 25% chance to score 1 or fewer goals
- Coming off back-to-back games (played last night)
- Facing Swayman, who has 5 games allowing 1 or fewer goals

2. Boston scoring pattern:
- Home games: Averaging 3.17 goals/game
- Coming off 6-goal performance
- Detroit on second night of back-to-back
- Detroit's defense fatigued from OT game last night

Projection:
Boston: 3-4 goals (likely closer to 3)
Detroit: 1-2 goals (likely closer to 2)

Final Score Projection: Boston 3, Detroit 2

Strongest Trends Supporting This:
- Detroit tends to keep games close but struggle to score
- Boston's home games average 5.5 total goals
- Both teams trend toward unders (DET 9-15 O/U, BOS 10-16-1 O/U)
- Second games of back-to-backs tend to be lower scoring

The total seems a bit high at 5.5/6 given both teams' under tendencies and Detroit's back-to-back situation.
