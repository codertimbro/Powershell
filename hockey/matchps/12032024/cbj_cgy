Trends:

2. Calgary has lost 4 straight
3. Columbus games have gone OVER in 5 of their last 6
4. Calgary games have gone UNDER in 6 of their last 10

Betting Recommendation:
- The OVER looks strong here. Columbus is scoring well lately (averaging 5.2 goals in their last 6 games)
- Columbus ATS is the better play given their recent form and Calgary's struggles
- Calgary has been particularly poor on the road (3-10 record)

The strongest play appears to be Columbus ATS, with OVER as a secondary play. Columbus's recent offensive explosion combined with Calgary's road struggles suggests value on the home team.
