The Boston Bruins are facing off against the Calgary Flames today, December 17, 2024. The Flames have been a delightful story to start the season, with a 6-5-1 record and a recent shutout win against the New Jersey Devils ¹. They're looking to keep their momentum going, but the Bruins will be a tough test.
As for the odds, I couldn't find the current over/under number or score for today's game. However, in their previous matchup on November 7, 2024, the Bruins won 4-3 against the Flames ².
The Bruins have been struggling to score at five-on-five, with only David Pastrnak and Justin Brazeau having more than three goals. Their roster flaws are being exposed, and they'll need to step up their offense to take on the Flames ³.
Reddit users are likely discussing the matchup, but I couldn't find any specific threads or comments on the game. However, the general feel is that the Flames are a force to be reckoned with this season, and the Bruins will need to bring their A-game to take them down.
Key Players to Watch:
David Pastrnak (RW): Bruins' top scorer, who's been consistent this season
Justin Brazeau (C): Bruins' second-line center, who's been contributing to their offense
Jacob Markstrom (G): Flames' starting goalie, who's been solid this season
Nikita Zadorov (D): Flames' top defenseman, who's been playing well this season
