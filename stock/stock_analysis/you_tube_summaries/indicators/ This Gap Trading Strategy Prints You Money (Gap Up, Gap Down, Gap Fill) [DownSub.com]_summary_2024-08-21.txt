in this video we're going to show you  how to trade price gaps like a pro  learning how to trade gaps correctly is  a cheat code that most Traders will  never discover as always please hit the  like button as it allows forour team to  continue to produce more free content on  YouTube what is a gap up a gap up is  when price opens higher than the  previous day's close you have your  candle Clos and Market close followed by  a gap up of price once the Market  opens what is a gap down  a gap down is when price opens lower  than the previous day's close you have  your candle close and Market close  before a gap down occurs once the Market  opens price gaps often occur due to news  releases outside of regular trading  hours that cause swings in price what is  a gap  fill a gap fill is when price returns to  the pregap  price you have your Gap up and price  isn't able to sustain the higher price  and reverses back to the pregap  price you have your gap down and price  isn't able to sustain the lower price  and reverses back to the pregap  price so why do Gap fills occur a gap  fill occurs when the driving force  behind what caused the Gap was based on  irrational or emotional factors and not  based on true fundamental factors if you  see a gap up and the reason for the Gap  up was based on something credible like  a surprise massive beat in earnings the  high High gapped up price will sustain  and even possibly go higher if you see a  gap up based on just a hype up news  piece or even fake news then the higher  gapped up price represents an  overvaluing of the stock also known as  overbought and the price will correct  back to the pregap price so that the  stock is back to being fairly priced now  a key Point The Wider the Gap is the  more overbought and overvalued the stock  is which can trigger a more drastic move  in the opposite direction wider gaps  make for better Gap fill reversal trades  going in the opposite  direction if you see a gap down and the  reason for the gap down was based on  something solid like a surprise Miss in  earnings the lower gapped down price  will sustain and even possibly go lower  if you see a gap down based on just a  hit piece or even fake news then the  lower gapped down price represents an  undervaluing of the stock also known as  oversold and the price will correct back  to the pregap price so that the stock is  back to being fairly priced Again The  Wider the Gap is the more oversold the  stock is which can trigger a more  drastic move in the opposite direction  wider gaps make for better Gap fill  reversal trades let's now dive into the  strategies  section combining price gaps with key  levels these reversal points give you  your key resistance Zone price then  forms a gap up and enters the Zone which  presents a short trade setup notice how  wide this Gap up is and the wider the  Gap the more overbought the stock is the  reason this is a great short trade setup  is because you have short sellers  looking to enter short trades at the  zone as well as the price of the stock  being overbought and overpriced as  always you need to look for an intraday  Trend change confirmation before taking  a short entry now along the bottom these  reversal points give you a key support  Zone you have a gap down into the  support Zone with multiple long with  candles and price being oversold which  presents a long trade setup another gap  down into the support Zone and price  being oversold which presents a long  trade setup let's show this  again this reversal Point here gives you  your key support level as price comes  back down you have a gap down slightly  past the Zone which is a false breakout  and traps a lot of breakout short  sellers false breakouts can trigger  drastic moves in the opposite direction  due to all those breakout short sellers  having their stop losses hit once price  reverses once you had the break of trend  line and higher high that is your Trend  change confirmation and is when you  would look for long trade  entries this is a quick In-N-Out trade  we took on the paler stock these  reversal points here give you your key  support Zone as price comes back down  you add a gap down into the Zone which  presents a long trade opportunity so you  need to look inside of this area here  but on a lower intraday time frame for a  trend change confirmation so let's pull  that up on the left is the paler daily  time frame we just looked at and on the  right is the paler intraday time frame  this trade setup area here is this same  area here you have a falling wedge  pattern and once it breaks above with a  gap up you would look for a long entry  point using our entry strategy your exit  Target would be this Zone here now  here's where the magic happens combining  price gaps with key levels and with  Ballinger Band  Breaks before we continue we want to  hear from you tell us in the comments  below right now what video topics we

is  extremely oversold once you have an  intraday Trend change confirmation you  would take a long entry using our entry  strategy let's show this  again these two reversal points give you  your wide support Zone price then gaps  down into the zone you also have a  candle that breaks far outside of the  Ballinger band which further confirms  the price is extremely oversold once you  have an intraday Trend chains  confirmation you would take a long  entry this is the Tesla stock trade we  took using this exact strategy these two  reversal points give you your key  support Zone that is also a a weekly  Zone this zone is also inside of the 50%  to 61.8% FIB Zone making it a  highquality area of value price then  gaps down into the zone and breaks  outside of the Ballinger band

wide Gap up into the  key Zone which presented a short trade  setup price also breaks outside of the  Ballinger band which represents an  extremely overbought price once you have  an intraday Trend change confirmation  you would take a short entry using our  entry strategy your target one is this  reversal Point  here this is the Vimeo stock this  reversal Point gives you your key  resistance Zone as price comes back up  you put a wide Gap up into the key Zone  which presented a short trade setup  price also breaks outside of the  Ballinger band which represents an  extremely overbought price again once  you have an intraday Trend change  confirmation you would take a short  entry now there are many Advanced  methods we use to find intraday Trend  change confirmations but here's one  simple  way this is the Disney short trade we  took these reversal points give you your  key Zone as price comes back up you had  a gap up into the key Zone which  presented a short trade setup price also  breaks outside of the Ballinger band  which represents an extremely overbought  price so you need to look inside of this  area here but on a lower intraday time  frame for a trend change confirmation so  let's pull that  up on the left is the Disney daily time  frame we just looked at and on the right  is the Disney intraday time frame this  setup area here is this same area here  you had a head and shoulders reversal  pattern and your entry could have been  on the break here or at the pullback but  a better entry is using our entry and  exit strategy so moving on a gap fill  completion at a key  level you have a clear strong moving  uptrend so you want to trade with the  trend these reversal points give you a  key level this is your Gap up here price  comes back down and fills the Gap right  at the key support level which presents  a long trade setup the reason this is a  high quality trade is because the Gap  fill completion means prices back to  being fairly priced so value buyers will  step in at this level short sellers will  also close trades at this level knowing  the Gap is filled and price no longer  being overbought key support level  buyers will also open long trades at  this level all of this creates an area  of Confluence and presents a highquality  long trade setup let's show this  again these reversal points give you a  key level this is your
