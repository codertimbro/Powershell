what makes a stock a great potential  candidate to day trade this stock went  up 300 in just a couple of hours while  most blue chip stocks you would have to  wait multiple years for that to take  place problem is usually when you see  these 300 plays you're late to the party  so how do we find these stocks that make  these massive moves like this before  they even happen so we can take  advantage of it reap the benefits and  get incredible gains well to understand  how to find big gainers we first have to  understand volume volume is the total  quantity of shares traded by traders for  a specific stock so the more buyers and  sellers the higher the volume volume can  be a great indication if a stock is hot  or not  think of it as almost the amount of eyes  watching a stock the more people  watching it the bigger the spikes as a  day trader you'll quickly realize price  movement is your friend that's why day  traders like volume so much because when  there's a lot of volume the price will  move a lot more giving us more  opportunities for trading plays while if  you trade a stock with little to no  volume it's not going to be moving as  much  resulting in fewer amounts of  opportunities not only that traders like  volume for liquidity reasons as if  you're a buyer and you want to sell your  position at a specific point you can  only sell that position if there's  another buyer it doesn't just poof out  of midair there needs to be someone else  on the other side of the transaction  when there are low amounts of volume it  might be hard for you to find another  buyer resulting it being harder for you  to exit your position so we now know the  impact volume has on a stock but what  creates the actual movement of a stock  well there's actually a few factors one  is scarcity i'm sure you've all heard  the good old supply and demand if there  is a low supply of something and a lot  of demand for it that'll increase the  price right so we identified that volume  is the demand in a type of way but how  do we identify the supply the answer the  float the flow is the total amount of  shares available for public investors to  buy and sell some companies like amazon  have 450 million shares out there in  circulation while other companies like  some penny stocks only have a couple  million shares out there every stock is  going to be different you can get this  number by going on yahoo finance  searching the ticker symbol click the  statistics tab and scroll down a bit  until you see the float section that's  the amount of shares available right now  now if we go back to the supply and  demand example if we want the price to  rise we want high amounts of volume  which is the demand and low amounts of  supply which is the float so in most  cases for day trading the lower the flow  the better as the less shares out there  creates more scarcity meaning bigger  price movements when i'm day trading i  like to find stocks that have a 20  million share flow or lower like i said  before the lower the better if it has  anything more than 20 million i won't  day trade it unless it's a really slow  day and there aren't a lot of options  out there if you ever find a stock that  has a massive amount of volume a low  flow and it's a top gainer you will  quickly see why this is a day trader's  dream because the amount of volatility  from this is like nothing you have ever  seen before you will literally have  single candles that make 10 moves so  when day trading those should really be  your filters lots of volume and a low  flow that's how moves like this exist  now filters are important and all but  what's even more important is a catalyst  news news is such a huge part of day  trading as a company with insanely great  news has a greater chance of blowing up  maybe they found a cure to a specific  type of cancer maybe they just made a  partnership with another big company or  maybe they just crushed their earnings  for that quarter all of these news  catalysts would result in a huge spike  in price for that specific stock  companies will release news articles  every single trading day in the morning  sometimes as early as four in the  morning to as late as 9am this is  eastern standard time by the way for the  most part the most important news  articles will come out at around 7am to  9am they will also usually come out at  round numbers so there will be a batch  of news articles that come out at 7 am  then another batch of articles at 7 30  then some more at 8. you get the idea  now not all news articles are good  sometimes companies will release an  article and say something like best buy  just announced it will repaint all of  its parking space lines in its parking  lot a bit exaggerated but you get the  point not all news articles are going to  result in huge spikes our goal is to  find the news article as early as  possible decipher if it's a good news  article or not then enter and hopefully  make a trade like this one where we get  in before everyone else even realizes  the news now i know what you're thinking  how do we find these news articles ah  yes how wise of you to be thinking that  well there's a few ways actually some  brokers will have a news section on  their platform and show all the recent  news articles that just came out but i  don't really like this strategy because  most of the time 95 of it is just fluff  and not very important articles  resulting in no price movement another  option is to use a stock screener so say  if it's 8 57 am and it's about to turn  nine sometimes i'll open my stock  screener and watch the top gainers of  the morning considering it automatically  refreshes i'll wait till it turns nine  o'clock scroll down a bit and maybe i  see a new ticker symbol pop up that  wasn't there before and it just spiked  up 10 you can then simply go to yahoo  finance which is completely free search  the ticker symbol then hopefully there's  a news article that came out in the past  10 minutes and you can hop on that train  before it leaves the station then this  10 gain might turn into a 50 game who  knows you can also do the same thing  with relative volume relative volume  tells us how many shares have been  traded in relation to how many shares  are usually traded so if a stock has a  relative volume of 60 that means the  volume right now is 60 times higher than  normal which in most cases means it has  a good news catalyst now these  strategies are nice don't get me wrong  and it definitely has worked for me  before the thing is it's not very  consistent for one you're just hoping a  new stock pops up on your screener and  sometimes that doesn't even happen then  two you're hoping you find it soon  enough to where you can search the  ticker symbol and find the news article  before it even blows up the problem with  that is if you're finding stocks that  are already up 10  most of the time you're already late and  the news article has already done its  work and that's the peak of the price  movement so we need to find stocks with  high amounts of volume low flow find  their news article as soon as they come  out and not just any articles but good  news articles to hopefully enter before  everyone else does one way i found great  success with this is using a new scanner  just like a stock scanner a new scanner  is constantly refreshing finding the  best news so instead of finding the  price movement first then searching up  the news article we get the news article  first and enter before the price has  even moved now there's a lot of  different new screeners out there some  are free but not as good some are great  but cost money there's a lot of options  this is up to you to find the right one  based off your needs but if you want  some help i'll put the one i use in the  description what i like about this one  is all the features it provides so  instead of searching for ticker symbols  it'll have a live feed of all the  articles that are released so you can  get on during key moments like we were  talking about before like 8 am or 9 am  and see if there are good news articles  that pop up what's even cooler is you  can add filters to the scanner so say if  you only want stocks priced between 1.20  stocks that have volume of 100k or more  and have a float of under 20 million  this scanner will only show you news  articles of stocks with those specific  requirements which is so damn powerful  and we really just scraped the surface  with the filters there are so many more  so you can watch the scanner at key  times have your filters enabled if you  see one pop up check it out read the  article and decipher how good the news  is the better the news the better the  spike the next thing you might be  wondering is how do you tell if a news  article is good well the more you trade  the better you get at identifying  articles on how good they are but for  all the beginners out there this is the  list i've made rating popular keywords  from best to worst if you see these  keywords in the title of the article  it's most likely a good news article the  better the keyword the better the  article so you can add this video to a  playlist or save the video or whatever  and just come back to the screenshot if  you want to rely on that but doing this  whole strategy with finding great news  articles and getting in plays like this  before they happen has worked wonders  for me so i thought i'd share with you  guys i should also know all these top  gainers might not be from news sometimes  stocks will spike up huge amounts  because they broke a key resistance  level sometimes for literally no reason  at all so you really could use that low  float slash volume strategy and just  trade the top gainers off technical  analysis that's completely fine too and  sometimes i even do that but i found  trading stocks with a low flow high  volume and a great news catalyst gives a  lot more consistent gains and you truly  feel a lot better and safer when day  trading a stock that has a good news  catalyst it's almost like trading a  stock that has a magnet above it pulling  it up so you can be more confident when  trading so you know how to find the  stocks when day trading but you also  need to know how to trade them correctly  well luckily for you i did the testing  for you i tested a trading strategy with  a hundred trades and it profited a  hundred and thirty percent in just two  months so yeah it's pretty good go check  that out thanks for watching and i'll  see you guys next time  [Music]
