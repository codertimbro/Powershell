if you're trying to find a profitable  trading strategy but you have work  school or other commitments that you  can't sit in front of the markets all  day to watch the charts in this video  I'm going to explain my one minute  scalping strategy that allows me to only  trade for the first 2 hours of the day  and then enjoy the rest of the day  because at the end of the day the reason  you want to be a full-time Trader is not  to sit in front of the charts all day  but rather you trade for freedom of time  and being able to do whatever you want  whenever you want so with that being  said let's get into the video so what is  the strategy the strategy involves a  5-minute opening candle as we know the  5-minute opening candle gives us a lot  of information on the one minute and the  one minute is where we're going to scalp  from now here we can see the 5 minute  opening candle but if you actually zoom  into the 5-minute opening Candle on the  one minute what do we see here well we  simply see range so this 5-minute candle  though it's bullish on the 1 minute time  frame we can see that there was multiple  candles making up this 5-minute opening  candle because of this what we want to  do is draw out the high and low of the  first 5minute candle and based off of  this we have four different scenarios  that we could enter the stock from this  allows us to not go into the day with a  bias but simply understand how to enter  the trade based off of the intraday  price action and just have quick scalps  to be done the day within the first 2  hours now the four scenarios we have  within the 5minute opening range is  simple for the two bullish scenarios we  see here it is simply moving down to the  5minute low and then holding holding  that level for a move potentially to the  upside and then number two for the  bullish side is a move above the 5  minute opening high and then R testing  the high because that's the lowest risk  entry for a move to high a bay and  continuation vice versa for the be side  we have the retest of that high of day  or 5 minute high for a move to the  downside or a break below the 5- minute  low and then a retest for a move of  course to the downside so every single  day there's four scenarios that could  potentially play out therefore if you're  someone that needs to take a trade a day  we talked about trade frequency in my  last video If you haven't watched it  it's such an important video however if  you guys understand trade frequency if  you're someone that wants to trade daily  this strategy may be for you I have  other strategy videos on my channel of  course however this strategy is probably  something that you can use more often  than the other ones just because every  day you will get the 5- minute high and  low and most likely if the stock isn't  consolidating you will get a break to  either side that you can play one of  these potential four scenarios out now  when we keep moving here this is simply  what we're looking for as you can see  here we had the break on the 5 minutes  see an impulsive candle strong  displacement a retest with a strong  price action candle our stop loss is a  close right below that 1 minute candle  and our profit Target here will simply  be high of day which is a 2.52 risk  toward trade now a couple things you  have to understand about this strategy  number one the average risk reward we're  looking for is simply a 2R multip if  you're scalping on the one minute chart  however for some people they want to go  on the higher time frame and that's  completely fine as well if you want to  trade this on the 2-minute the 5 minute  even the 10minute all you have to do is  just go higher in time frames for  example if you want to trade the  2-minute opening range you may want to  Mark out the first 10minute candle and  then look for the retest of that however  for me what works the best for scalping  is the 1 minute time frame because the  most precision and the highest reward is  going to be on the one minute time frame  if you can Master volatility now with  this being said as long as you  understand price action which I have a  full in-depth guide explaining how to  read price action and candlesticks as  long as you understand that concept this  strategy is extremely effective now in  this video what I'm going to do is back  test this exact strategy that I just  explained to you guys over a onewe  period on spy and based off that onewe  continuous back testing all we're going  to do is look for one trade a day we're  going to trade from 9 :0 a.m. eastern  time to 11 a.m. eastern time and the  purpose of this video is to give you  multiple examples so you can come back  to this video at any time in the future  and rewatch The examples to see exactly  how I enter the trade compared to how  you may have entered your trade and also  to give you realistic results over a  onewe time frame I'm going to do it  continuously and therefore you're going  to be able to see the results over a one  we period rather than me going and  looking at hindsight or cherry-picked  examples so with that being said let's  get into the the example all right so  here we can see we are opening up on  Thursday on spy and I'm going to do this  over a 1e period therefore I'm going to  do it till Wednesday now of course for  back testing results this isn't enough  data so I recommend you go and back test  this yourself as well but I just want to  show you over a onee period if this  strategy is going to be profitable or  not so the first thing we have to do on  the first 5 minute candle here is simply  Mark out the high and the low of the  first 5 minute candle now we go to the 1  minute time frame and on the 1 minute  time frame you can see of course we have  a little bit more data here we can see  this candle came up strong we had an  impulsive move to the upside we then  rejected this high and now we're coming  back down so of course the 1 minute  gives you a little bit more data that  you weren't able to see on that one  5minute candle and now what we're simply  waiting for is what we talked about  earlier number one is either a hold of  this level and a push to the upside  number two is either a break of The  Upside and a retest for a move once  again to the upside or or we're looking  for a break and retest of the downside  or a rejection of that 5-minute high for  a move to the downside so those are the  four scenarios that we're looking at for  this specific trade now let's play out  the trade and see exactly what  happens so one thing I want you guys to  notice here as well is as we moved up  here we broke the level but then we came  back and we Consolidated so this break  right here doesn't show enough  displacement what displacement means is  it's simply the move from the key break  of the level all the way down before we  get the retest back into our Zone and we  need displacement to of course enter the  trade with this level here we can see we  broke and then this candle pushed right  back up above our level therefore this  level so far has been invalidated for a  move to the downside this is where  understanding price action is key but so  far we have not entered into this trade  because we haven't gotten any bullish or  bearish signals near our key  levels as we can see here we're simply  just consolidating so far we haven't  created a clear Trend and the reason I  can't take this for a potential move to  the upside is because we have actually  broken that level and then moved back up  and therefore so far this is simply a  choppy day and now what I would be  waiting for the only way I would play  this day is if we broke the 52421 level  for a retest or if we broke the 525  level up here for the  retest here now we see this displacement  what we see here is displacement what  this refers to is an impulsive move  after the breakout this means that now  sellers are in control and therefore we  are now looking for a retest of this  previous 5 minute low so let's keep  playing out this  trade and as we can see right here what  we're getting is that rejection of the  trade we can see we pushed back up into  that 5minute opening range and we're  getting a bearish inverted Hammer candle  we also see that the green candle was  not able to close above the 5-minute low  and therefore we can enter into this  trade here now we would enter into a  short position and this trade is fairly  simple our stop loss can simply be a  break of this green candle right here  because once again if we go back into  this 5minute opening range this means  most likely we're going to consolidate  how we did back here and our profit  Target here can simply be low of day now  this is a  3.79 our multiple trade we enter into a  short position here and let's see  exactly what happens  and we made a very nice move to the  downside now this was a  $325 day on Thursday I'm going to back  test until Wednesday and at the end of  the video I'll show you the results for  the full week the total p&l the amount  we risked and the amount we actually  profited so make sure to stick to the  end but with this being said let's go  over to the next day on Friday all right  here we are on Friday I marked out the  opening High and the opening low for the  first 5-minute candle and now all we're  waiting for is the four potential  scenarios to set up so let's play out  this  trade and as we can see we got a very  strong move to the upside right at the  beginning of the day now what we're  waiting for is the retest the retest  opportunity is down here and then a push  to the upside so let's see if we can get  that potential  move now here's a scenario where the  trade does not occur the reason this is  is because when we push back in here  this candle right here had no strong  price action if this candle closed like  the candle down here then of course we  would be able to enter Because this  candle shows that sellers made the stock  go all the way down but buyers brought  it all the way back up and closed it  with the strong Hammer candle  unfortunately with this candle we can  see that buyers did try to bring it up  but then sellers came all the way at the  top and closed it below our specific key  level and because of this we can't enter  into this trade based off of the weak  price action and we still need to wait  for a potential trade to set up so you  can see with the stry you only enter A+  trades and it allows you to not enter  into these subpar trades because of the  price action that's presented near these  key levels so let's keep playing out  this  trade so we had the move initially and  now we have the displacement so now  after we did break to the upside but  most buyers got faked out to the  downside if we do retest this low with  the weak price action candle this would  be a perfect entry for a short position  so let's play out this  trade and as we can see here we came up  and we actually retested this level  right here and then we put in a weak  price action candle so how would I enter  into this trade specifically well I  would be looking for a short position  here and my stop- loss in this specific  trade would be this impulsive candle  that tried to break this level therefore  my stop loss would be up here and for my  profit Target because low of day is so  close we would have to look at previous  day levels or even psychological numbers  now in this example here we can see that  the pre previous day low actually occurs  right here at  52134 this is the previous day low and  therefore this can be used as a profit  Target for this specific trade so if we  were to enter into this trade here our  profit Target would be all the way down  here with our stop loss of course being  at the close of this impulsive candle  High because once again if we come back  into that level we could potentially  just have range or move to the upside so  this is a 3.49 R trade once again we  enter into a short position and let's  play out this  trade this was a solid trade all the way  down to those lows and this was a  $1,090 trade so this was Friday in this  example we were able to see how we only  enter A+ trades now let's go over to  Monday to continue our week here we are  on Monday I marked out the high and low  of the first 5minute opening range now  let's play out this trade and see  exactly what happens so as we can see in  the beginning of the day we were just  consolidating in between 5291 16s and  528 61s now we can see a strong move to  the downside with a strong displacement  so all we're simply looking for is the  retest of this displacement and then the  rejection of that low so let's play out  this trade and see if we can get that  retest now here's an interesting  scenario now this was a 10:00 news pop  however after the news pop you can see  that the news had the rejection of 5291  16s and then we continue to reject on  the next candle with a very weak candle  so how would I potentially play this  trade out I would look to enter into a  short position here my stop loss would  simply be a break Above This 101 candle  and the reason being for that is because  once again we come right back into range  if we do break back into that 528 61  level and of course as we talked about  earlier we need at least a 2 R multiple  now within that two our multiple what I  can see is this  526 level based off of this 526 level  right here this would give us around a  2.04 r trade and therefore because I  trade at least a 2 R multiple that's my  average risk to reward I can enter into  this trade so let's enter into a short  position here now some people are going  to ask why 526 this is a whole  psychological number if you haven't  watched my other videos it's very  crucial that you go watch those as well  just to understand more things about  price action Market structure and  exactly how I'm entering and exiting  this trade but you just need to  understand that this is a whole  psychological number and this is where  institutions mainly buy or sell at  because it is a whole number now let's  play out this trade so far as we can see  we are simply just  consolidating and there we go there's  that 526 level we can see that was  $950 on the day with a  2.04 r trade so so that's Monday so far  we've done 3 days we have two more days  left so let's go over to Tuesday once  again now we're on Tuesday I marked out  the first 5 minute opening high and low  let's play out this  trade and as we can see here this is a  different trade than we've taken so far  however what we're getting here is a  rejection into the open a move down and  then a rejection once again off 52677  which is the high of the 5 minute so so  we can look for a potential short  position because this is such a weak and  bearish candle looking for a move down  to 52577 and our stop loss in this case  scenario would simply just be above high  of day in this scenario here we can just  put it at  52690 so this would be a 3.52 risk to  reward trade let's enter into a short  position here and see exactly what  happens  unfortunately as we were making that  move down right we did have an impulsive  candle to the upside and because of this  we did hit our stop loss here and  because we wait for the candle to close  the candle closed right here and this  was a minus  $235 trade now of course with every  strategy this is why I'm doing it over  the onee period this isn't Cherry pictor  hindsight examples but what I want to  show you guys is that every strategy  right you will lose because this isn't  textbook and I'm showing you in the real  Market at what happened literally last  week you see that I lost the $235 but  because of the proper risk management it  wasn't that big of a loss because every  trade is over to or multiple and  therefore what that means is even if we  lose one trade or two trades on the  third trade if we win that we will still  be profitable or break even and  therefore this $235 loss is completely  fine on the Tuesday now let's go over to  Wednesday which is the final day of the  week and then we'll do the final total  profits for the whole week here we are  on Wednesday this is the last day of the  week for us because we started on  Thursday therefore this was one week of  back testing this is once again 5-  minute candles we're looking for those  four potential scenarios to play out for  this week so let's play out this trade  as we can see we're currently breaking  that 5312 level we're going to be  looking for the retest now this retest  here we see that it came back up and we  actually are pushing above the retest  level therefore there's no weak price  action just yet for us to enter in on  now we can see that we did break again  to the downside this time a stronger  displacement making a new low of day  showing low of day continuation and  therefore now we are looking for once  again that retest of 530 12s hopefully  this time we can get a little bit better  price action now in this scenario here  we can see that we're retesting with a  weak price action candle we came back up  and we are printing a we candle that is  closing as a red candle with a clear top  right here so we can enter into a short  position like we talked about before our  stop loss in this scenario would just  simply have to be above this previous  pivot level right here and for our  profit Target if we simply do low of day  that's only a 1.69 R multiple like I  talked about we need at least a two R  multiple so we can actually scroll back  out on the day and as we can see this  previous day high level is what we can  Target because that's a pivot level on  The Daily time frame which holds a lot  of emphasis on the chart we can have  this as our profit Target which would  give us once again a 2.93 r multiple  trade we can enter into a short position  here and let's see exactly how this  trade plays  out now this candle right here was a  news candle at 10:00 and because of how  fast it happened most likely you weren't  going to be able to get out of your  trade and therefore I want to make this  realistic therefore we're not going to  count this as a profit Target because it  did happen so fast that realistically  you weren't going to be able to get out  of that position that fast  however as we can see even with that  news candle we did make a move down now  we can obviously exit out of the trade  and this was a  $490 trade to end off the week now let's  go over and see the results of the week  the total profit the amount we risked  and the risk reward multiple that we had  per trade okay now we're here for the  results of the total week there was only  five trading days for the week of course  and therefore we took one trade a day I  hope you guys noticed that with this  strategy it's more about quality of  trades in quantity for myself I like to  only take one to two quality A+ trades  per day I don't like to push the limit  over that and recently I've only been  taking one trade per day and it's been  working out extremely well and here we  can see we took five trades four of them  won which was an 80% win rate now with  this win rate we have to look at the  results so when we look at the results  these are the five trades that we took  we can see the r multiple so 3.79 3.49  2.04 3.52 and 2.93 what this means is is  for for every dollar that we risked we  would have made  $379 for that trade so if we risk $1  that dollar would have turned into $379  now as you can see for most of these  it's much over that 2 R multiple and if  you average all of these out it would  come out to around a three R multiple  for this specific week but in my  personal opinion as long as your R  multiple is over two that's still  completely fine with this strategy as we  can see on the first day we made $325  then we made $1,090 $950 on the third  day we lost $235 on trade 4 and we won  $490 on trade five one thing I want you  to notice as well notice the loss  compared to all of the wins the loss is  so much smaller because our R multiple  is so high therefore for you as a new  Trader or if you've been trading for a  little while just understand your risk  management and the way you use your R  multiple will take you much further than  trying to get the best win rate and this  is why in my opinion risk management and  your R multiple is key to your trading  success now when we look at the results  for the 5 days that we back tested  because there's five trading days in a  week we made  $2,620 for the week now of course like I  said this is just a onewe back test just  just show you a little bit more  realistic results and examples so you  can come back to this video and rewatch  it however I always recommend try to  back test the strategies yourself to  increase your confidence and conviction  to actually enter and use the setup so  with that being said if this video  helped you make sure to give it a like  if you have any questions put
