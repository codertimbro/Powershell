all right welcome back everyone today  we're going to be talking about stock  screeners why to use them and how to use  them and then I'm going to give you a  couple examples of what I think are the  two best afternoon scans as well as the  best by far the best morning scans so  welcome back everyone I am lead trainer  with stocks trade Tim Bowen let's talk  about why to use a stock screener or a  stock scanner those terms are kind of  interchangeable I know they kind of even  I quite frequently go back and forth  like to me a scanner is slightly  different like a scanner is just going  to give you a bunch of stocks a screener  is what we're talking about today  because the whole idea of a screener  it's like think about panning for gold  you know you're you're sifting through  all of the junk and then you're left  with the gold you know the dirt and the  Rocks go away the gold stays so I will  interchange those terms I do apologize  screener is the proper tool for this  video but cut me some slack this is you  know live baby so anyway what we're  looking for with a screener is think  about there's 19 000 stocks okay  depending on the day depending on how  accurate the market is I mean like you  can't sit down and research and analyze  19 000 stocks I mean it's just not  reasonable if it took you 10 seconds  each I mean that's 19 000 seconds the  trading day is over okay so you can't do  1900 you can't do 190 I mean if if  you're uh uh seasoned Trader you could  probably analyze 19 stocks pretty  quickly okay but as a newer Trader which  I'm assuming you are because you're  checking out the channel which is great  welcome aboard but what you have to do  is a newer Trader is you're still  building your process you don't know  necessarily what stock or what news move  stocks what what news affects stocks the  most you have to it is imperative to get  down to the smallest list of stocks as  possible like I would love it if you  were just looking at less than probably  less than five most days that's not  reasonable some days it is like today  vcig was absolutely beautiful you know  the very first stock we went over on the  morning webinar 8 30 Eastern I'll talk  about that in a little bit you can  actually join me every single trading  Day live at 8 30 Eastern  vcig broke the double top from last week  artificial intelligence press release  low folk stock good volume 450 break is  key  um those moves have been working lately  and if I jump over there you'll see the  stock broke 450 let me zoom in at about  10 30 a.m and went almost immediately to  11 30. okay the re the way I found vcig  was using Oracle okay this is that  number one morning screener and what's  great about this is several things it's  instant okay this is a a black box  algorithm  so with one click Oracle gives me the  most volatile pre-market stocks one  claim in a matter of milliseconds let me  show you I'm going to open a new tab and  I'm gonna hit Oracle and look at that  right there's a vsig space Mara some of  these great Runners today all with just  one click now you'll also notice that  there's about 15 stocks here and a lot  of them have directional bias Okay the  reason they're directional bias the red  stocks are short the green Stacks are  long now not to get too into Short  Selling I know it's confusing for a lot  of people but you can make money when  stocks go down those are the stocks you  look too short but what's great is  if I want to look at low flow stocks  with news that are big morning Runners  you know I can simply just filter by the  float and if I drop in you know  traditionally we're looking at less than  10 million shares in the float and  you'll see that whoops  so ten one two three one two three and  if I filter now you can see I've got  five stocks five stocks and only one  stock is green directional bias and  guess which one it is the absolute best  stock of the day vcig so that is one  thing I recommend all of you do in the  morning  is you get Oracle Now understand Oracle  is proprietary and exclusive to stocks  to trade okay so click that link below  check it out get it try it I think  you'll be blown away and simply look at  that like again if you're a new Trader  you're probably not looking to short  stocks yet so you're looking to go along  you'll notice one stock is green one  stock has an entry stigel at 3.95 and it  was by far the best stock of the day and  and even if I went through and analyzed  all five of these I would have had just  a few minutes each okay if you use the  daily income Trader system it's a it's a  criteria and it's a process and a  methodology to find the best stocks  let's say I spent five minutes per stock  like like let's say you are short seller  bias I've got five stocks that I can  spend five minutes on and I can be ready  for the trading day in 25 minutes  certainly reasonable I would hope I  would hope all of you have realistic  expectations and I would hope all of you  are willing to spend 25 minutes a day to  find something like v-cig that went from  four dollars and fifty cents after it  was already up huge mind you mind you I  mean this thing was already up from two  to four but it went from 450 to 11. okay  over one that's almost 150 percent move  from the signal that we talked about on  the morning webinar I would hope you'd  be willing to spend 25 minutes to find  that so that shows you how you can get  down from 19 000 stocks to a handful  next screener we're going to go over is  that afternoon view app hold  um I've got a lot of videos on this one  so I will keep this a little bit briefer  it's just a summary what we love about  v-wap is the number one uh technical  indicator that basically every day  trader is using if you're not using view  app add it to your charts learn it check  out the archive we have  at this point I probably have hundreds  of v-wap videos take advantage of that  because listen even if I did a view app  video five years ago it's still  applicable today it's the same technical  indicator and these are the same  patterns so this technique this screener  you'll see is giving me stocks that are  big gainers trading high volume and are  what's called hugging V web and I'm  gonna run this one run it live and  you'll see one two three four five  beautiful  stocks aaoi has been very strong we're  actually looking at that for an  afternoon breakout but again now like  let's say you can't trade in the morning  you can only trade afternoons so you  maybe you're you know you didn't trade  visig in the morning on Oracle and you  come back maybe you work till noon or  something you sit down you fire up the  view apps can five stops you know and  again it varies day by day some days it  might be seven some days it might be two  I mean some days there's none which if  there's none it just tells you there's  no great trading opportunities and you  come back the next day remember more  trading isn't better what is better is  trading the best setups not just  throwing stuff at the wall and hoping  for the best so actually I just had one  more pop on so I got six yeah I can  actually remember this is real time so  and he just dropped it off actually but  real-time scanner so you can be  analyzing those stocks as they pop on  more of a day trade strategy and then  the other one we look for for those  overnight gappers and you should  understand and learn how a learn a  gapper strategy Okay the reason I want  you to learn a gap or strategy is very  pattern day trader friendly I'm guessing  a lot of you are under the PDT you can  actually you know cap relies on being  under the PDT by taking these stocks  overnight it's got to be the right  stocks okay and this scan may look very  simple but it actually is crazy powerful  some of the best swing trades and some  of the best gappers come from this so  we're just looking for stocks that are  trading big volume they're up uh you  know they're above a dollar a share  and they're basically hugging the  52-week High versus v-wap and we're  looking for stocks that have pierced and  pulled back wow crazy bullish day out  there though so man um it's very bullish  out there so you'll see I got 60 stocks  on here but if I filter by volume you  can see I've got about 10 before they  trap drop below uh 2 million shares a  day so I really wouldn't look to Gap  anything with with less than 2 million  shares on the day I just like to see  this to look for sympathy plays but you  can see at the top I mean listen if  you're looking to Gap stocks swing  stocks hold long term look at what we  got at the top baby Nvidia I mean look  at the look at those six month chart of  Nvidia incredible the Stock's still  breaking out Apple Apple's just been  crushing Cisco Delta Airlines actually  been very good we kind of a lot of these  travel places have been coming back  Dropbox great technology company okay so  now you can see that a lot of these  great safer plays to either Gap or or  swing trade are right there and again if  you drop down and you ignore the stocks  less than 2 million you got about 10  stocks to go through two minutes maybe  five minutes of stock takes a little  longer but it's a very busy day very  bullish day out there a lot of days you  run this scan I mean we've just been on  an amazing Bull Run it's it's the middle  of June pretty crazy probably by the  time you see this stock markets will be  at all-time highs last couple months  just been crazy bullish and the scan  actually represents that you can  actually use that scan to determine how  bullish and bearish you should be like I  wouldn't be shorting anything right now  when you've got every single Technology  stock as well as construction stocks and  and travel stocks and me just everything  breaking out time to get bullish baby so  that being said my friends if you learn  from
