starting trading the right way and  mastering it can allow you to create an  income generating machine for yourself  granting you time Freedom location  freedom and the ability to scale your  income working from anywhere in the  world but if you're trading with no  Foundation or the wrong Foundation  especially if you're just starting off  you can easily waste years of your life  and thousands of dollars of your money  that you simply don't need to waste so  that's why in this video I'm going to be  laying out the foundation that took me 7  years of full-time trading with all  sorts of trial and error before now  being able to make thousand do in a  single day day trading so whether you're  trading and you have some experience or  you're starting off with absolutely zero  experience I'll be showing in teaching  you the boil down version of all the  most important things that I've learned  including Market psychology softwares  and charting trading math which is one  of the biggest pitfalls for beginner  Traders custom tools I'm going to share  with you to be able to advance your  trading faster and access to Capital so  you can start with the small amount of  money but still be able to trade so that  by the end of this video you're going to  have a clear-cut path to mastering Trad  and hopefully creating that income  generating machine for yourself so if  that sounds good

lesson one we're  going to start off with something  completely different than what you'd  think most people when they start  trading want to jump into technical  analysis charts and immediately start  trying to put money into the market  whereas one of the biggest pitfalls for  a Trader is going to be something that  has nothing to do with actually trading  and all to do with your mind mindset  without first rewiring your mindset  being successful in trading is going to  be almost impossible if you take human  traits it will conventionally make you  successful in regular life and apply  that over to trading it will almost give  you the exact opposite effect and cause  you to lose more money so that's why a  lot of the smartest people the most  successful people are actually the worst  Traders because they're so stubborn and  so successful in regular life they can't  believe that applying that same logic to  the markets will actually cause them to  lose and that's what causes them to spy  okay flipping that on its head with  trading you have to rewire those  conventional thoughts and think opposite  to basically everything in life that  you've ever learned one of the biggest  and best decisions that I made in my  trading career was reading a book called  trading in the zone written by Mark  Douglas who is a trading psychologist  okay I've made several videos about this  sort of referring to this as the Bible  of trading but I promise you this can't  be closer to the truth I'm going to show  you some key points here to get us  started on this video but I strongly  suggest once you make it to the end of  this video to get this book take your  time reading it and see how much it's  going to change your trading and one of  the first things that he talks about in  this book is Shifting to mental analysis  and understanding how mindset plays a  critical role as he States pretty early  on he's worked with some of the best in  some of the worst traders in the  business and has helped some of the  worst become some of the best some of  these specific reasons that these  successful Traders are able to  outperform others is because the best  Traders are able to think differently  from the rest of everyone else and this  is exactly what I'm trying to harp on  okay these winners have attained a  mindset a set of attitudes that allow  them to remain disciplined focused and  above all confident despite adverse  conditions and all of the concepts that  I'm going to show you in this video are  going to tie into this exact thing which  basically being a good loser because  you're being so stringent on your rules  that instead of trying to mask emotions  you actually learn to understand why  emotions in trading actually will  disappear if you're trading properly  trust me this is going to make a lot  more sense before dive into full  technical analysis I want to show you  sort of the bridge between psychology  and the actual markets because I think a  lot of people end up looking at charts  starting trading without fully  understanding what the meaning of the  charts are what's actually going on and  how this ties into human psychology  which at the end of the day when you're  trading you're battling with a  collective group of people making  decisions based on all sorts of factors  to try to be able to make more money  than the other person okay this is  player versus player when someone makes  money another person is losing money  there's a wide spectrum of distribution  depending on how many people involved  how much money is involved at different  points but that's essentially what  you're looking at so when we look over  at a chart here okay I'm using a  software called trading view this is  basically the gold standard in the  trading industry as far as looking at  trading data okay but even though it  looks like we're just looking at  squiggly lines here on a chart what  we're actually looking at is the visual  representation of mass human psychology  when prices are moving up it means that  more people as a whole whole are willing  to pay more and more money this price is  increasing because people are willing to  buy at higher and higher prices from one  another because they feel that it is  still worth getting in as the price  increases and that demand outweighing  the supply causes the price to move up  same thing in the opposite direction  when we have a downtrend okay there are  buyers still coming in through here as  this price is trading down less and less  people are willing to hold the price at  a certain level and people that are  willing to buy at lower prices are  taking from people that are offloading  this because there's too much Supply and  not enough demand causing the price to  move down and there's different ways of  looking at this data some people like to  look at it in a line but most of the  time Traders are going to be looking at  these which are called candlesticks okay  and you'll notice that there's white  candles in Orange candles you can make  these on trading view by right clicking  on the chart you can make these any  color you want right here but  essentially the reason this candle is  white is because for this 3 minute  interval the price opened right at this  level went as low as this level went as  high as this point and ended up closing  at this level since this closed higher  than that that gives us a positive gain  over this 3 minute period which means  that the candle will be white same  concept with the orange candles but  because they're orange it shows me that  the price opened here when as high as  this point when as low as this point and  ended up closing right here at this  level once again making the candle  orange and showing us a net negative  movement on this candle over that 3  minute increment okay and if you've  watched my videos we use all all sorts  of different tools sort of understand on  a deeper level what this data is showing  us so that we're able to make calculated  trading decisions off of this so all of  the indicators and technical analysis  that I'm going to get into in lesson  three is going to be a deeper dive into  sort of digesting and understanding how  to interact with the mass human  psychology with the data which is once  again the representation of collective  mass human psychology so our charts are  really telling us a story if this is a  bit confusing to you wait till the end  of the video all this is going to come  together and you're going to leave here  a lot more in the no so just bear with  me if you're a little confused right now  it's going to make more sense so now I  want to share with you some of the  biggest things that I've noticed is the  difference between a successful and a  non-successful Trader and some of the  foundational stuff that I harp on with  the team that I know I now have that  basically every single not successful  Trader doesn't have Mark Douglas also  touches on this point that everybody is  trading with the same information the  prot Traders the institutions retail  Traders now have access to the same  exact data so that there's no magic  indicator there's no missing piece of  information that is going to make us  successful it has everything to do with  how we actually apply ourselves into an  infinite amount of opportunities and an  infinite amount of possibilities to make  money in the market with all of the data  okay there's millions of combinations  that will make you successful there's  also millions that won't so it's up to  you to give you that foundation and to  know that you're following the right  process to do that that's where the  discipline comes in and that's why most  people aren't successful and I'm going  to break down all of those things right  here onto the list list and then we're  going to look at an example okay so out  of the pro trading Foundation we first  have trade selection so being able to  find patterns to be able to take trades  on that fit your system rules the second  thing is trade execution so having the  discipline to be able to enter at the  right level and also knowing how to  interact with your exchange to say take  a position here and set up your risk  parameters to make sure that you're  calculating risk on the trade so you can  protect yourself on the downside and let  your winning trades really move in your  direction to allow you profitability  Okay the third thing is going to be  trade management so once you are  actually in a trade knowing where you're  going to get out ahead of time okay  whether it's for a win or for a loss is  one of the most critical things in  trading that a lot of beginners simply  aren't going to do they're going to use  their emotions they're going to go all  down rabbit holes saying oh I should  have held I should have got out here  okay you're going to learn in a second  why that's really stupid based on the  mathematical premises of trading that  I'm going to show you okay and then the  fourth and final most important thing  especially when you're learning is  tracking your data and being able to  analyze your performance I'll never  forget this term from Andrew who's been  one of the core Traders on our team for  the past several years and he always  says you cannot improve what you don't  measure okay this doesn't only apply to  trading this applies to life in general  if you want to improve something you  need to be able to find the source of  the problem okay you need to know where  you stand and how changes that you make  are going to affect your outcome and the  only way to do that is to dial in know  your own data and take a look at that  data and make changes that have  statistical backing to actually improve  your performance okay and because that  part is so important if any one of these  things isn't being followed to a te it's  almost impossible to quantify anything  if you're doing that you might as well  kiss trading goodbye you're never going  to be able to make money consistently  because this is what's going to separate  the successful Traders from the  non-successful Traders but do it from  the perspective of someone who is  following the rules and isn't following  the rules I'm just showing you an  example of some intricacies in trading  systems that would constitute as rules  the proper Trader would put his risk  below the B level would buy at this  point and then look to take profit if  the price continues moving up once he  sees his highlight strip here he'll  calculate his position size so that he  knows he's risking say for example  exactly $100 so even if he is wrong he  knows the percentage of the time he's  right and how much money on average he's  making to then be able to know his  success rate over the course of certain  trades okay so that trade comes down  gets him out for a full loss so he loses  $100 on this trade so then the next  trade comes once again the trader sees  where the price breaks out of this point  the stop loss below this B level which  is where he will sell out of the  position if the position once again goes  down against him and we'll wait for a  highlight strip to be able to take  profit on this trade calculates the risk  on the trade once again risking $100 on  the position okay so now we're into the  trade once again waiting for either this  level to be hit or a highlight strip on  my RSI  right so right here we get our highlight  strip on our RSI and they close out the  trade for full profit now profiting on  the win  $153 now putting them up $50 after two  trades then after the trade the trader  logs all of the data the profit and loss  on the trading system and simply moves  on to the next let's follow that same  exact process but now from an incorrect  mindset so we can see the difference  between successful and not successful so  an inexperienced Trader would see that  this move is breaking out of this trend  they would look to enter into the market  here with either a random amount of  units depending on how they feel on the  trade okay but nonetheless entering the  position okay so the trade starts moving  down and the trade stops them out for a  full loss if they entered with a random  amount now we have no idea how much we  lost on that trade okay the bad Trader  would either look to shift strategies  and say well that didn't work so I got  to try to add something I got to add a  new indicator to the strategy or I got  to change something so that I don't lose  again so then we come to our next trade  setup once again broken through this  level say the trader takes a long  position here puts a stop loss below  this level and then just like our last  example the price starts coming down so  maybe the trader decides okay this isn't  working out so I'm going to take the  trade off the table at a small loss just  so that I don't lose too much more money  or maybe now that it's at break even we  just avoided that loss so I'm going to  take this off the table for flat and  then move on to the next trade so then  maybe they're not even in the trade  anymore and then it starts moving  drastically in the direction so they say  okay well it's stting to move in the  direction I should at least get a little  bit of something into this trade enter  in late here where now we should be  exiting the position but this time if  we're risking $100 on this trade now to  our full takeprofit level based on this  indecision in here or a wide variety of  psychological mistakes that may seem  like you're seeing if the trade is going  to work out to be able to then get in  now caused you to only make 78 of what  you were risking on the trade so now  even though they were right about the  position and had the exact same idea as  as a successful Trader their mindset  only allowed them to make $78 so now  they're actually making less on their  winning trades then they're risking to  lose on their trades in general so you  can see the difference in mindset and  you can see how trade selection is  important right but also the technical  execution the management of the trade  and then once again tracking your data  by the way I'm going to be sharing this  exact template on notion so you can  start practicing what I'm going to be  showing you as we proceed and get a  little further into this video okay if  you're still here and you're enjoying  make sure you hit the like button so we  can share this with the world and  hopefully have a lot more Traders  thinking and acting in the right ways  all right so getting into lesson two  we're going to be talking about all of  the softwares that you need to start  trading as well as some simple technical  analysis that you can use to start  dominating the charts that will give you  a really good foundation to start doing  technical analysis in general when it  comes to softwares you're going to need  about three basic ones okay so the first  is going to be trading view which is  where you're going to be doing all of  your trading okay I have a referral link  if you want to join but I do recommend  every single year on Black Friday they  do 70% off the annual subscription so  don't get it now save the link and then  use it during Black Friday you'll be  able to save a lot of money in your  trading view they literally do it every  single year and that's when I pay for  mine so you know the second biggest  thing I would say is going to be a  trading journal right now I've been  building in notion and this is the  public version of a master trade log  that I'm working on to be able to put my  entire database of information into  notion but I'm going to share this with  you in the description below as well for  completely free and I'm going to show  you how to use this in a little bit all  right and the third thing you're going  to need is an exchange so where you're  actually going to be placing these  trades so I trade cryptocurrency the  reason I like crypto is because the  markets are open 24/7 so it makes it a  lot more flexible for me when I'm  traveling and with my sort of Lifestyle  okay secondarily there's not that many  really complex things that are going to  move the market in unexpected ways or  with something like Forex the market  moves with all sorts of complex  geopolitical news and things that are  going on between monetary policies of  countries which I personally am just not  smart enough Andor care enough to track  so with crypto I can follow the basic  news let the markets move on that and  then be able to trade it at any time  anywhere and the good thing is you don't  need to start with that much money as  well so you can really start with say  $100 and be able to trade with say  something like $10,000 and if you do  that properly you're not adding any more  risk but it's allowing you to take real  siiz trades and not have to put that  much money of your own up on the table  so we have our software our charting  platform our trade journal and our  exchange are going to be the primary  things that you're going to need like I  said a little bit earlier the first  thing that people want to do when they  first start trading is hop right onto  the exchange and start placing orders  but that's actually realistically the  last thing that you should be doing once  you have the proof of concept you  understand exactly what you're doing  okay so forget about the exchange for  now and just focus on actually learning  how to do this in learning the process  for yourself so if you have all sorts of  crazy stuff all over your chart and  you're not finding the success in  trading that you want or if you're brand  new what I want you to do is open up a  brand new chart on trading view with  nothing on it besides your candlesticks  and I'm going to show you how to start  quantifying Trends and how to start  doing Simple technical analysis to  actually be able to understand the  market so that then we're adding all of  the indicators to the Chart after we  understand the foundational layer of  what we're really trying to do in the  first place so like I explained earlier  when we're looking at the chart all  we're looking at is the collective buy  and sell decisions in the mass human  psychology behind all of the market  participants okay and moreover we're  seeing areas of supply and demand and  considering these supply and demand  criteria we can use something called  trend lines or Trends to evaluate and  guess where there could be pockets of  supply and demand which can largely put  us in positions where the price is  likely to reverse in which case if we  buy in an area like this and we have  reason to believe that the price will  turn around and create a new trend this  will allow us to get in early on the  trend and say be able to risk $100 here  but if we're right we're making 6x what  we're risking which would equal to say  something like $600 and if we can find  patterns in the market and indicators  that can support this decision we only  have to be right a very small amount of  the time to be able to still end up  making money even if we're losing seven  out of 10 total trades okay but it  really does come down to the system MTH  that we're going to dive into in just a  second but I want to keep focusing a  little bit more on this technical  analysis in the supply and demand so for  example if we're using our trend lines  we can often times anticipate areas  where the price will come down and where  exactly they will end up reversing okay  so right now I'm on a 15minute  frequencies so each of these candles is  showing us 15 minutes so all of this  price data is basically the course of 1  month so if we zoom in there's going to  be all sorts of different opportunities  in here but I want to keep it a little  zoomed out and show you just how I start  to look at technical analysis as a whole  so if I look at my lowest point here  right here this is going to give me a  trend all right there's also a tool  right here called The Parallel channel  that you can use where basically if you  click along that level say that low  level click again and then you just move  your cursor up to say some of these  other levels all right it's going to  show you an exact parallel line from say  a low point on a trend to some of your  high points on this trend which as you  can see as the price moved up here then  once again moving into the future  rejected that price and then caused the  price to continue trending down the  other way okay so say for example if we  had this point here this point here this  point here I can go along this top piece  of price action starting from from here  and then click down to this lowest point  right here okay there's a ton of other  indicators that I use to be able to make  sure that we're not going to be missing  this constantly but I'm trying to  explain to you how to evaluate Trends I  can also notice inside of this overall  trend we have this low and this low  tested here once again where the price  broke down through this came up to test  the underside of this before  capitulating down okay so this is  another Trend that was broken so now we  have a fair amount of conviction that  wherever this price ends up touching  this lower point because of this  previous pocket of Supply pocket of  supply and then demand pocket here we  could expect to have another demand  pocket here anticipating the demand  outweighing the supply and then  potentially anticipating a reversal here  and once again this is hindsight we  looked at the chart already I don't want  anyone being like yeah you looked at the  chart already this is how we're trading  I'm just showing you that it does work  okay so now the price took a little bit  longer to get down so now we can  anticipate this level being our low okay  so now price is is at the low point of  this trend right there we're starting to  get some level of support all right and  if you see if I went off of that exact  High over there and then back down  generally in this vicinity is where we  got the price to take a significant flip  before getting our move up and we can  draw these Trend breaks and start to see  the beginning of ends of different  Trends all over our chart once again we  have this trend break here then we have  our new Al low established a downtrend  right here a downtrend right here along  these lows which you can see the price  rejected off momentarily before breaking  through that Trend if we also look at  this trend after this level was tested a  bunch of times and then was broken out  through the price came down and retested  the opposite side of what's called  resistance where basically say the price  is moving up and there's a level where  the price can't seem to break through  that's called resistance and then the  same thing with support if the price is  trending down and it runs into a level  that the price is having trouble  breaking down through that's something  called support and this is one of the  biggest things to understand with supp  supply and demand trading and just  trading Trends in general excluding all  of the indicators and all the other  technical analysis when you have enough  Force to break through this trend line  that doesn't mean that this wall of  buyers and sellers has all of a sudden  disappeared it just means that the price  is strong enough to break it and almost  all the time when we have a retest on  the opposite time this is something I  coined as an overside or Underside  retest this is often times a really  really good point to then look to buy  into because the chances are this level  is going to be a new big area of support  before the price ends up pushing up and  making new highs we can see examples of  this all over the chart so notice right  here we have this high this high price  breaks up over this trend comes back  down to retest this area and then ends  up making a significant move higher if  we look at this trend along this low and  this low price tests the trend more and  more closely together breaks down  through it comes up tests the opposite  side of this trend before having a new  trend break down down all right so you  can see by reading supply and demand and  not having all sorts of cluttered  indicators all over your chart you can  get an idea of where you want to be  entering and exiting the market and then  using tasteful indicators like something  like an RSI or other things that I use  that I'm not going to get into in this  video you can watch more about them in  videos that I'll link in a card right  here get to get into a little bit more  of the mud of the exact indicators that  I use you can start to see how  professional Traders are really reading  price action Trend analysis and supply  and demand and using tasteful indicators  in rule-based systems to be able to  enter the market so let's do a trade  example here incorporating the next  thing that I want to talk about it's  going to be all about position sizing  and trading math which is one of the  most important components of this game  okay the patterns are great the entries  are great being able to read Trends but  you have to know how to position  yourself in the market to quantify risk  and make sure that you're keeping things  uniform so then you can go ahead and  journal them and make your trading  better all right so let's learn what  we've used so far so we can draw our  lower trend line here which is matching  up nicely to our high points right here  all right but say we wanted to take a  trade on this trend in here now we have  price making contact right here then  breaking out of this level touching here  then continuing on its way so now notice  we have an overall uptrend here break of  a downtrend here with new price action  trending up similar to what we saw here  on a larger scale with the price now  starting to Trend up so if I drop into a  lower time frame say something like a  15-minute frequency you can now see a  trend establishing here with a rejection  off of that high click down to our low  Point here so now notice price is coming  down hasn't had much movement to the  upside and is coming right into our  potential support zone so this is an  area where we'd want to potentially to  buy into this cryptocurrency make sure  we set our risk so that then we'd be  able to take a profit if this is to flip  in the opposite direction and as far as  trading math is concerned there's two  main metrics that you need to be  calculating in order to see if you're  successful which is your average risk  reward and your winning percentage so  how many times you're right versus wrong  and when you are right about a trade how  much money are you making versus how  much you risking when you lose so the  way we're calculating winning percentage  is seeing how many trades obviously we  win that's going to play into our trade  Journal here in just a second but as far  as average risk reward in prot trading  we're using something called risk  factors so whether you're using $10 as  the risk on your trade or you're using  $1,000 as risk on the trade both of  these whatever your risk if you are  wrong and have to close the trade out  for a contained loss is going to be one  unit of risk okay so say in the example  here if the price does move up and get  us to this area right here we can see if  we hover over our position calculator  that would mean we made  3.55 x what we were risking on the trade  which would mean that we would have  3.55 risk factors okay so if we took one  loss and one win we would lose one risk  factor and we would gain 3.55 which  would leave us at a net positive of Plus  plus  2.55 risk factors times however much  we're risking on the trade would be  equal to our profit so that's it that's  trading math if you can figure out when  you're winning and how many risk factors  you're averaging on your trade you'll be  able to know exactly whether or not your  system is actually working but the only  way to do that properly is by properly  calculating this unit of risk here I can  already tell you a ton of Traders don't  even do in the first place so we  actually have an indicator that goes  right on your chart that will allow you  to do this as well but I want to explain  to you how the math actually works so in  order to create this one unit of risk  right here we need to be able to know  how much money we'll lose if the price  is to enter us here and then obviously  exit US here so what we're going to do  mathematically is we're going to take  the entry level right here which is  8.09 and subtract that by our stop- loss  value which is  7.97 then we're going to take the dollar  amount we want to risk on our position  say for example here it's $100 and we're  going to take1 $ and divide it by the  difference between the entry and the  stop loss to give us the total amount of  units to buy at this price in order to  risk the exact amount here all right so  entry minus stop loss equals this 1338  to $100 divide by 138 will give us  7246 units that we have to purchase at  this level so once again if we do  purchase that many units at this level  and the price ends up moving against us  we're going to have this many units  traveling that distance which is going  to give us  a100 which is going to give us exactly  one risk factor now I like to do this  math when I'm trading just on a  calculator because I find it easy and  faster now we actually have indicators  in the resource sheet below the video  here called the inevit trade position  size calculator you can just click on  that and add it to your favorites and  you'll see there'll be a little prompt  here that says entry price so all you  have to do is hover your mouse over here  click on the exact level you want to  enter put your take profit level and  then click on your exact stop loss level  input the dollar amount risk that you  want hit apply and over here it's going  to show you the exact quantity that you  need to buy your entry take profit stop  loss and your expected profit and your  exact risk reward on the trade now now I  clicked on slightly different levels so  you have a little bit of a difference in  the units here but overall this is going  to do it a lot faster for you put it  right on chart you'll be able to manage  these in real time and it will update it  depending on where you move it okay so  say price comes down we buy 732 at that  level now we know based off of our stop  loss how much money we're actually  risking all right you can see the price  is going to chop around when we're in  profitable trades but we know we have a  uniform amount of risk so that even if  we are wrong about the trade it's  predetermined and you can see price  comes up gets through the take-profit  level and just as expected when the  price reached that specific point we  locked in the  $368 which is just around $10 off of our  expected profit okay so this allowed us  to lock in positive  3.68 risk factors and so so with  something like a 3:1 risk factor all you  need to do is be right 30% of the time  meaning that you can lose 7 out of 10  trades and still wind up being  profitable here's a table that I  designed that I'll share with you in the  description of the video as well as a  cheat sheet to some of our systems and  other resources okay to show you based  on your winning percentage and your  average risk reward whether or not  you'll be Break Even profitable or not  profitable when we're young kids were  wired to think when we are wrong or lose  money it's behavior that needs to be  corrected whereas in trading you  actually need to go into trades knowing  that whatever your winning percentage  probability that you will lose the trade  in order to open up the opportunity for  this to flip and be able to get you out  for the positive amount of risk factors  which say in this example you had 3.68  risk factors * 3 wins would equal to 11  total risk factors and say you lost once  again 70% of the time so one risk factor  times 7even trades would equal -7 risk  factors which would net you out positive  for risk factors times however much  you're risking on your trade which would  equal to $400 in profit over say for  example 10 trades once again being wrong  70% of the time so the reason why we're  tracking all of this data is to figure  out those two metrics average winning  percentage in your risk reward so that  then we can see how many risk factors  you'll make over 10 100 trades and  that's how you end up turning profitable  and that's why being emotional about  trades is actually really dumb once you  realize it's really about just following  all of the procedures sticking to the  system as closely as possible to let  what you already know to be true  mathematically come to fruition that's  why when people say to me oh you trade  you must have nerves of Steel I'm like  not really I just understand math and  that's a weird Paradox that like I said  99% of people are just not quite  mentally designed to understand and  obviously the systems as you learn more  get a little bit more complicated but  this is exactly what we're harping on  with our private team this is a Concepts  that all of these team members are  focusing on in order to knock down  trades and start working towards this  consistency once again the charts can  look a little bit complicated but once  you get to that next level it all starts  making sense with the foundational layer  of the general technical analysis shout  out Danny V for the nice ARB win all  right this is where I want to get into  Lesson Four where we talk about access  to Capital so on this position we just  went over we were once again risking  $100 but in order to risk $100 you can  see right here we needed around 730  units which at our entry point of  $810 would give us around like  $592 Capital requirement in order for us  to take this trade so if you weren't  using leverage you would need to have  $6,000 in your account just to put a  trade on to risk $100 this is where the  exchange comes in handy so the  Partnerships we have are in the  description of the video okay you can  use different exchanges make sure you  read the terms of services before you  use exchanges for the case of Adam once  again say I was entering at $810 cense  with my 730 units once again that  Capital requirement would be that  $5,900 same amount of dollar risk same  amount of expected profit and the good  thing is we can use something called  Leverage you can see if we increase this  to something like 50 leverage and hit  confirm now we have the same exact  position but now the capital requirement  on that trade is only  $125 okay even if we move this down to  something like say 10x leverage now we  can put on a $100 risk in the cap  Capital requirement for that trade is  now once again only $600 essentially  dividing the capital requirement by 10  okay so this is going to allow you to  get your proof of concept but not have  to use a tremendous amount of idle cash  sitting in your account to be able to  take trades with say 25 $500 risk okay  and this is why I like to use leverage  when I'm taking trades because if I'm  risking a couple thousand on a trade I  don't want to have to have $60 70,000  worth of capital just sitting in my  account okay I'd rather put that to good  use elsewhere the system and then use  that comfortable amount of Leverage to  be able to still take these trades all  right so let's get into lesson five  which is journaling and practicing your  trading so once you have your system you  understand the analysis and you  understand all of these elements your  trade Journal is going to be where all  of that information including your  winning percentage average risk reward  average risk factor and total amount of  profit is going to all be calculated  along with a ton of other details for  you to be able to look at all of your  losing trades all of your winning trades  and what I've done here I've set up a  few fil filters so in our inputs we put  our date the day that we've taken it the  coin or pair we've traded the system  type you traded time frame whether it  was long or short okay some other  metrics that I use in different trading  systems the risk percentage whether it  was a win or a loss and then the p&l  okay you can put fees in here and you  can put other notes Here I have a  confidence meter duration and then a  slot for pre and post trade notes so you  can keep track of where your Psychology  was at at that moment this is once again  just an example that I share with the  public okay so you can filter over here  if you just wanted to look at one type  of system okay these are all one but you  can filter by that type of system if you  want to look at only all of your losses  okay if there was a loss example in here  now it would filter all of your losses  if you wanted to look at all of your  wins you could just click that and it  would show you all of your wins right so  if you are taking a new trade you can  pop one of these hit the open Tab and  fill this information out as you go as  well as hitting trade input right here  and then clicking on adding an image and  adding your screenshot so that then you  can look at all of the losing trades  look at the similari look at the data  behind it and try to optimize that over  time once again you can't improve what  you don't measure that's an exact way to  measure once again going to be shared  with you in the description of the video  so you can get started you can make a  copy you can make changes to It Whatever  once you have your system down instead  of waiting for the market to develop and  wasting time trying it in real life you  can use a feature to practice and track  your Edge and make sure that you're  going to be successful by using a  feature called bar replay okay what this  is going to allow you to do is say we go  back in time with Adam to a point where  we don't even remember what happened I'm  not even looking at the chart okay and  you can click at that point and then you  can use this menu here to play the  candles forward and then be able to  decide without remembering what happened  in real time where you would end up  taking trades okay you can redo some of  your analysis in real time and see how  it comes to fruition and then practice  inputting those trades into a test say  do a bar replay test for say 2 weeks of  time lock in for 3 hours 4 hours and see  what your result would be so that you  have the confidence that moving forward  into the markets you can trade that into  the future with a solid understanding of  where your mindsets at how you're  selecting your trades how you're doing  with your technical execution how you're  managing the trades and also how you're  tracking and analyzing and improving  your own performance so obviously this  isn't an easy feat this is something  that is mastered over years and years  but I wanted to give you guys a solid  foundation to cut out a lot of the crap  and a lot of the confusion to just give  you this sinful base layer to be able to  build up your trading system and build  that wealth generating machine for  yourself and once again a lot of our  private team members came into trading  without any experience and now they're  shredding more advanced concepts so you  can see
