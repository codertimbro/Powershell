in today's video I'll show you my secret  process to find the best stocks today  trade and the system I have in place to  filter out the bad stocks and focus on  the ones with the highest profit  potential first you want to look for  stocks that are liquid this means that  there are a lot of buyers and sellers in  the market which makes it easier to  enter and exit trades without affecting  the price too much also you want to  focus on stocks that are volatile  a stock that moves a lot in price  throughout the day gives you more  chances to buy low and sell High another  important factor to consider is the  overall Market Trend you want to trade  stocks that are moving in the same  direction as the overall market so when  the market is bullish you want to trade  stocks that are showing strength now  let's get specific here are the exact  filters that I always use in finis  screener  average volume is perhaps the most  important filter for finding liquid  stocks average volume refers to the  number of shares traded on average each  day the higher the volume the more  liquid the stock is likely to be I  usually set this filter to over 1  million shares to ensure that there are  enough buyers and sellers in the market  the more shares that are being traded  each day the easier it is to enter and  exit positions without causing a major  impact on the  price while not directly related to  liquidity the price of a stock can also  impact how easily you can trade it I  generally recommend setting the price  filter to over $30 to avoid stocks that  are too cheap and may not have enough  volume setting the price filter to over  $30 can be a good way to ensure that  your trade stocks with adequate  liquidity these stocks tend to attract  more institutional investors and large  Traders I try to avoid lower price  stocks because they often have smaller  market capitalizations and fewer shares  outstanding which can make them more  susceptible to big price swings and  manipulation another important filter  you must use is the relative volume  relative volume compares the current  trading volume of a stock to its average  volume over a specific period typically  the past 30 trading days when a stock is  trading at a higher volume than usual it  tells us that there's increased interest  and activity around that stock and when  there's increased interest in a stock  there's often a greater potential for  significant price action I recommend  setting the relative volume filter to  over one when looking for stocks today  day trade or scalp a relative volume of  one means that the stock is trading at  its average volume also if you want to  be more aggressive you could set the  relative volume filter to over two a  relative volume above two indicates that  the stock is trading at more than twice  its normal volume which is a strong  signal of increased Market interest and  potential for significant price  action  as short-term Traders we are looking for  stocks that can make big moves in a  short period of time we want to get in  ride the momentum and get out with a  quick profit and stocks with a high beta  are more likely to give us those  opportunities beta is a measure of a  Stock's volatility in relation to the  overall Market as represented by the  snp500 index essentially it quantifies  how sensitive a stock is to Broad Market  swings now the market beta Baseline is  one so stocks with a beta above one tend  to be more volatile than the General  market while stocks with a beta below  one tend to be less  volatile by screening specifically for  stocks with a beta higher than one we  focus on names that historically  demonstrate above average volatility  compared to the market a beta of 1.5 for  example means that the stock is 50% more  volatile than the market so if the  market moves up 1% the stock should  theoretically move up  1.5% by setting the beta filter to over  one you can quickly narrow down your  list of potential trades to only the  most volatile names depending on market  conditions and your strategy you might  set the filter to over 1.5 or even over  [Music]  two I also set the market cap filter to  over $1 billion this way we can quickly  narrow down our list of potential trades  to only the most established and  actively traded names when we're talking  about stocks with a market cap over $1  billion we're talking about the big  leagues these are the companies that  have the attention of the major players  on Wall Street stocks with a market cap  over $1 billion also tend to be more  stable and less prone to manipulation  these are established companies with  solid fundamentals and a track record of  success the average true range is one of  my favorite indicators for measuring  volatility and potential profit  opportunities in simple terms ATR  measures the average range of a stocks  price movement over a given period of  time typically 14 days when a stock has  has a high ATR it means that it's  experiencing significant price swings on  a regular basis the price is moving up  and down more dramatically than a stock  with a lower ATR I like to set the ATR  filter on finis to over1 this helps me  quickly identify stocks that are  experiencing a high level of volatility  and potential for significant price  movement and that's exactly what we want  to see as day Traders stocks that are  making big moves and creating  opportunities the size of a stocks float  can also have a big impact on its  volatility and liquidity when we talk  about a stock float we are talking about  the number of shares that are actually  available for trading on the open market  that's why I usually recommend setting  the float filter to over 10 million when  scanning for potential trades this helps  to ensure that there are enough shares  available for trading and that the stock  is less likely to experience sudden  erratic price  swings the 50-day simple moving average  is my go-to indicator to get a more  complete picture of a stocks Trend you  can also use the 20-day moving average  as an additional filter the 20-day SMA  is a shorter term indicator that's more  sensitive to recent price action it's  great for identifying potential Trend  changes in the near term the 50-day SMA  is a longer term indicator that's less  sensitive to short-term price  fluctuations it takes more time to  change course but when it does it can be  a powerful signal of a more significant  Trend change if a stock is trading above  both the 20-day and 50-day SMA that's a  strong sign that it's in a  wellestablished uptrend the shorter term  and longer term Trends are aligned and  the stock has a lot of bullish momentum  behind  [Music]  it an up Gap occurs when a stock opens  significantly higher than its previous  day close gaps are often a sign of  strong momentum and sentiment in a  particular direction when a stock gaps  up it means that there was a lot of  buying pressure and demand for that  stock in the pre-market or after hours  trading sessions this is why I love to  use the Gap up over 1% filter when I'm  scanning for potential momentum traits  by looking for stocks that have gapped  up by more than 1% I can quickly  identify names that are experiencing  significant overnight moves and that may  be poised for continued momentum in the  same direction for example if a stock  gaps up on high volume and with a wide  range that's often a a sign of strong  bullish momentum that could continue  throughout the trading day combined with  the previous filter the 50-day moving  average if the broader Market is in an  uptrend and experiencing positive  sentiment that may provide a Tailwind  for stocks that Gap up and increase the  likelihood of continued  momentum the 52e H low filter is a  powerful tool for identifying stocks  that are trading near their highest  levels in the past year and that may be  poised for a breakout or continuation  move these are the highest and lowest  prices that a stock has traded at over  the past year or 52 weeks they represent  the extremes of a stocks price range  during that time period and can provide  important context for its current price  action I like to use the 0% 10% below  High filter and we're looking for a  stock that are trading within 10% of  their 52- we high price in other words  we want to find stocks that are close to  breaking out to new Highs but haven't  quite gotten there yet when a stock is  trading near its 52 week high it means  that there is a lot of bullish sentiment  and momentum behind it and by focusing  on stocks that are very close to making  new highs you will easily identify names  that may be on the verge of a big move  Higher by combining these 10 filters  you're essentially creating a powerful  system that identifies the most  promising stocks for day trading  remember the market is always changing  and you'll need to be flexible in your  approach there may be times when  applying all this filters will result in  a very small list of stocks or even no  stocks at all in these situations it's  okay to adjust slightly the strategy and  loosen some of the the filters to widen  your pool of potential traits for  example if you're left with only several  stocks to choose from skip the Gap up  filter or adjust the 52 week high low  one this will expand your list to  include more potential stocks to day  trade by using this comprehensive set of  filters you're putting the odds in your  favor and giving yourself the best  possible chance to find the stocks with  the highest profit potential  and now it's time to trade them these  videos will show you my favorite day  trading  [Music]  strategies
