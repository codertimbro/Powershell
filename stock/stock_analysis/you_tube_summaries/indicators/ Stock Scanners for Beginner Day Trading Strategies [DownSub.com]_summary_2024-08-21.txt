[Laughter]  what's up everyone all right so in this  episode I'm going to walk you through  the scanners that I use every single day  while I'm day trading now scanners are  very important these are where you find  stocks that are moving so what I did  probably different from most people is I  hired a development team to build out my  own set of custom scanners and I've been  using these now for a long time as many  of you already know so I'm going to walk  you through each of those scanners right  now in this episode but I also want you  to know that my team is constantly  working on building out new scanners at  my request I'll say Hey you know I  really am looking for whatever uh right  now I'm looking for a scanner that  focuses primarily on recent IPOs d-spac  type of companies because those have  been particularly strong so we've got  that scanner right now that's in  development that I'm working on so if  you're watching this weeks or months  from now there may be some variations  there may be some new scanners that have  been added to my library of scans but  one of the things that I learned is I  was starting trading was that all of my  winners for the most part a share  similar cut characteristics in terms of  the actual stock in terms of price float  volume there's a number of  characteristics that they all share and  so if I can find a stock that is meeting  most of those characteristics before  it's gone you know made its entire move  that's what I really need to be seeing  those are the type of alerts they look  for so I've built out these scanners to  look for those types of stocks many of  you guys know these scanners I've made  available to Warrior Pro members over at  Warrior trading these scanners are also  available for members over at daytrade  Dash so if you want to check out either  warriortrader day trade Dash there'll be  links right down in the description I'll  probably pin one to the comments so you  can check it out and for those that are  curious if you have more questions leave  them down down below or if you have  suggestions of scanners that you'd like  to see me build out leave those below as  well I can add them to the list and I  think it's interesting then I'll have my  team work on it so thanks for watching  this episode I hope you really enjoy it  and as always if you do please hit the  thumbs up makes a huge difference with  the channel alright so let's jump in and  start talking about these scanners  okay so I'm going to walk you through  the stock scanners that I use every  single day this is a tool that I hired a  development team to build for me I use  this every day in my trading and I built  it to make it available to members at  Warrior trading and members of day trade  Dash so these scanners I'm going to walk  you through the different scanners that  are available right now we are  constantly adding to the library of  scanners and we're also from time to  time making tweaks to improve scanners  this is a little different than  um perhaps software you've used in the  past in that I've actually developed  each of these scanners to look for very  specific types of setups and I find this  to be more helpful  for me because when something pops up on  the scanner I know exactly whether or  not it's worth looking at number one and  then number two as a member using this  software I think it's helpful for you  because you don't have to try to just  sort of  re-engineer like how does he develop a  scanner and try to piece it together  yourself you could just literally plug  and play and use the scanner exactly as  I use it every single day so this is  basically the way I have it when I first  log in which you can see here it's  fairly focused on small cap stocks and  of course that's the strategy that I'm  trading every day so like right now  surge is hitting the scanner now we'd  actually have to make the scanner either  make it a little bit bigger or scroll it  over to see the exact alert that's  hitting it's low flow former Momo stock  and so these are the different  strategies that are all built into this  alert window you see medium flow High  relative volume squeeze alert I'm going  to walk you through which each what each  one of these is looking for specifically  but this is the scanning window that I  use  um the most frequently to find stocks to  um for that are good candidates for  momentum all right  so from the tools section over in the  corner you can click on scanners and the  first item is stock quote right here now  the stock quote is actually this window  that I have in the middle and this  allows you to type in a stock like I did  for apple or you could type in another  one and you can quickly see some  information about the stock probably the  most helpful one is float right so you  could check the flow and you can see  whether or not this is a float that  you're interested in so sometimes  someone will mention a stock and they'll  say hey check out kspn and I'm like oh I  don't see it on my scanners so one of  the first things I'm curious about is  what's the float uh floats 1.6 million  shares okay now I know that information  is relevant I I understand what float is  of course if you're watching this and  you're not clear on what float is uh I  can put some links down in the  description of this video where you can  better understand some of the  terminology but uh I as an active Trader  I understand the importance of float and  so now I might be more interested in  kspn although I would also ask myself  well it's clearly uh not meeting the  criteria to hit this High a day momentum  scanner at least not right now at this  moment and so that must say something  about what's going on with the stock  so there's basically two types of  scanners uh that are part of this  platform there's scanners that are a  list which is like our top uh gainers  after hours this is a list of stocks and  it's sorted as you can see right here  you could sort it differently if you'd  prefer you could sort it by Price you  could sort by volume you could sort by  float you can sort however you want  let's see I've got two combined in there  but the way I usually do it is I leave  it sorted by a percentage change from  the close and so after hours yesterday  for instance we had this really big move  on hsdt and apdn so at 4 pm I was  watching this after hours list of course  a lot of the stocks that were on this  we're still hitting the high day  momentum scanner they were still moving  higher but  this gives you a list so if I close out  um a couple of these and this is our  Newsroom so I'll close this out here so  um we'll start by going over the lists  so my top gappers is a list this is a  list of all the stocks gapping as you  can see here more than seven percent  gapping up more than seven percent and  gapping down more than seven percent  this is helpful for me because it shows  me the biggest moves in the market so I  sort this by gapper initially percentage  gapper  then you see the symbol you can click on  the symbol if you want to read the news  about it and so if we click on this it  look on Warrior it'll come over to the  warrior website where we can see  different headlines right down here all  right so we can see what the news is  right there  breaking news is posted in The Newsroom  so this is like breaking news headline  it'll get posted here likely before it  even hits the website so this is  breaking news whereas clicking here is  this is where you'll see like oh they  had earnings posted yesterday or  something like that something that's  very you know very obvious whatever it  is  so we've got the symbol then we have the  price we have the volume which is the  number of shares traded today we have  the float now I color flow and  prioritize lower float stocks because we  know lower float stocks are the ones  that can make really big moves so we  have from lowest float and then it kind  of goes into a gradient as the float  gets higher as we get to the highest  float I sort of lose interest in it  completely I'm just like now these  really aren't the type of stocks I'm  particularly interested in I know I'm  rarely going to trade you know a 700  million share float stock  so you could sort this every day by  float I think the two ways that are  helpful is to store it by volume to just  check to see where's the volume this  morning  and then to sort it by Gap  we also have columns here for relative  volume this is very important as many of  you know I'm a big advocate of trading  stocks with high relative volume so  highest relative volume today is on pstx  if we refer to the chart on this we'll  see pstx has made this really pretty  phenomenal move from 350 up to 550 has  news so it's moving higher  we've got relative volume in the last  five minutes now this is an interesting  one because this is helpful for seeing  volume spiking up and moving right now  it's a little different than daily  relative volume because it's just  showing you in this current time frame  how quickly it's moving we've got the  change from the close uh the ATR rate  average true range we've got short  interest short ratio and and we can  scroll over and there's going to be some  more columns here that you can look at  if you're interested but in the effort  of keeping this relatively concise  um I think I'll let me well actually  um I want to I want to go over two other  lists generally speaking these lists are  they're all going to have the same  pretty much the same criteria here  you've got so top gainers  this is again sorted by a percentage  gain you've got symbol price volume flow  relative volume volume on the five Gap  how much it gapped up short interest  short ratio all right now if we switch  over to uh the next one down we've got  top relative volume  all right so top relative volume is  giving us our relative volume leaders  today so these are the stocks with the  highest relative volume right now we of  course like these uh these are the  stocks generally that we're going to be  focusing on making quick moves High  relative volume go hand in hand all  right volatility  then we've got uh top RSI this is a this  is a bit more of a reversal list but  it's showing you the stocks that have  the highest and the lowest RSI over the  last five minutes these can be good for  reversal indicators so worth watching  these if you're a reversal Trader  specifically  if you like shorting tops and buying  lows  top volume in the last five minutes  this is showing you the stock to the  highest volume in the last five minutes  these this can be helpful for finding  current volume spikes what's moving  right now although I typically would use  my high day momentum scanner for that  we also have top losers all right so  we've got the top gainers and then we've  got the top losers side by side  rearrange this here I'll put this up  here  I'll move this one over here  so top gainers top losers  all right and let's see top gainers top  losers top RSI top relative volume top  volume in the last five minutes  and we had  um after hours gainers which I think I  already showed you that's right here so  this starts working at 4 pm this doesn't  work so right now it's showing you it  says not today it's showing you  yesterday's after hours it doesn't work  during regular trading hours it is just  an after hours scanner  um and oh I've got my continuation  scanner so the continuation scanner this  is an interesting one because  um this is specifically giving you a  list of stocks that have made big moves  in the last two weeks and this is a  great list to go through just to look  for momentum stocks some of these could  be setting up for a daily breakout a  bull flag a flat top breakout maybe a  reversal so usually these stocks are  worth keeping an eye on as part of  building out sort of your daily watch  list  and then I've got a couple others that  we're working on that are still in  development  um one of them that I'm working on but  hasn't been uh it's in beta hasn't been  released to everyone yet is recent top  IPO stocks moving this is one that  um many of you will enjoy because we've  had a lot of momentum on recent IPO  stocks pgy that was a recent IPO stock  right  HKD recent IPO stock so that's one of  the ones that will be coming soon it's  going to be a top list of recent IPOs  that are moving higher right okay so  this is um these are all of the you know  the top stocks and the list goes down it  might be it might even be a hundred  stocks  on some of these lists uh at least 50.  so you've got a pretty good list  probably more than you need but  again you it gives you something to work  with as you're putting together your  daily watch list all right so I'm gonna  um X Out of these close them up  okay  so we're back to top gappers and I'll  switch to sorting by percentage Gap all  right so now let's look at  um okay so we looked at the the list  here  we've got a couple more lists we have  um let's see  Penny top gappers so this is a top Gap  or specifically prep for penny stocks  lower price stocks all right so we'll go  down you know 10 cent 12 13 stocks  really cheap ones but we'll show up to  three four five dollars so we do show  slightly higher price but you know more  of traditional penny stocks which I  typically uh don't trade  then we have a large cap top gappers so  these are large cap stocks so you'll see  stocks with larger market caps on here  PayPal Tupperware  Etc and then you have large cap with  earnings so these are large caps that  are gapping up that have had earnings  and this gives you the report date of  when the earnings were so earnings  within I believe it's 48 hours so we're  either right before or right after  earnings or something very very close to  earnings  uh and then I believe yep those are  um that that is oh and then the last one  is a list of um stocks getting halted  this is uh I suppose actually not  technically a list this is the first  scanner that is an alert so this gives  you a time stamp of the alert and it's  telling you a stock that was halted so  stocks that are halted up here here on  this list so you can see oh the stock is  halted maybe it's worth taking a look at  you know HKD is halted coming down okay  hsdt this one is halted um as well  coming down that's pretty dramatic uh  earlier we had kspn halted going up so  you've got some halts on here this can  be helpful just for keeping an eye on  what's moving  now uh the next  set of scanners I want to go over are  my small cap High day momentum scanners  so this is a this is an alert style as  well so these are scanners they're  giving you an alert with a time stamp of  when a stock meets certain criteria and  you can see kspn was lighting up the  scanner it was actually hitting multiple  scanners all at the same time low float  High relative volume scanner  so low float and high relative volume  that's what we're looking for priced  under 20 so a stock with a lower float  and very high relative volume moving  right now price under 20. we have low  float former Momo stock that this is  also hitting which means this is a stock  that in the past has made a big move and  you can see right back here that big  move now when I'm scanning for low float  former Momo stock  the scanners are a little bit different  because low float former momo stocks  when they pick up they can start moving  really quickly and so for that reason I  want to see them a little sooner than  maybe your ordinary stock so some of the  filters are adjusted a little bit so I  can see whether or not this is something  that so I could see it quicker so I  could see it faster  I don't do that for every type of stock  because otherwise you start getting a  lot of false alerts and I don't want  false alerts I want good quality alerts  so and then the other scanner that it's  hitting is squeeze up alert up 10 in 10  minutes that's valid squeezing up moving  fast right now I like to see those  stocks because if they're moving quickly  it may be something worth watching now  you can see that costs actually hit the  low float former Momo stock but only hit  it once it triggered it once which might  have been an opportunity to pull it up  and take a look and you probably see ah  it doesn't have a lot of volume just  sort of popped up probably not going to  trade it so a stock hitting scanners  more and more times is definitely a good  indicator that it's got some momentum  and it's worth watching  some of the other scanners in here in  this window  we've got squeeze up alert up five  percent in five minutes so that's kind  of like a pre-alert for something  possibly that will go up 10 in 10  minutes but it's just moving faster on  um on the five percent in five minutes  so we have a little bit of a pre-alert  there usually if something just blows  right through it's going to trigger the  other one  kspn is hitting the scans again up there  at five  uh let's see we've got medium float High  relative volume price under 20. usually  when you have a stock that's under 20  and it has a medium float you're going  to have high degree of algorithmic  trading it's going to be a more of a  grinder it's not usually something I'm  going to really look at for momentum  Trading but a medium float that's under  20 that has really really high relative  volume it can be worth looking at as you  can see with pstx right pstx the float  is a little higher but it did make a  nice move so it was it was worth  watching  kspn moving just a smidge higher there  up to 520 which is good  uh so we've got medium float High  relative volume price under 20.  pstx was hitting that one earlier uh we  have  uh let's go a little further down  all right so I'll refer to my list over  here we've got the different scanners in  this low float medium relative volume  low flow but medium relative volume  those can be alerts that are worth  looking at we prefer higher relative  volume but maybe you're just seeing  we're seeing and getting alert to the  stock early in the move and it's just  starting to take off so looking for more  relative volume to come in low float  High relative volume that's the one  where we're going to usually see big  momentum type of stocks watching that  closely low float High relative volume  price over 20. higher price these ones  can have bigger spreads they can be a  little bit choppier are worth watching  with the high relative volume but manage  your risk low float for Momo stock  already showed you that one medium float  medium relative volume price 20 and up  again sometimes you can have one that's  a little bit higher price medium  relative volume but with a higher price  uh starts to open up a little bit not my  favorite scanner not one that I would  typically put the audio alerts on so I  only have the audio alerts enabled for  low float and squeezing up 10 in 10  minutes the others I I don't use audio  alerts for I just don't I don't find  them important enough that I want to get  an audio alert for it  uh so medium float High relative volume  price 20 and up medium float High  relative volume price under 20.  squeeze up 10 10 minutes squeeze up five  percent in five minutes  and then a 52-week breakout so 52-week  breakout is  um high of year high of the last 52  weeks that can be uh helpful some  Traders would take profit at 52-week  highs some short sellers would cover  other short sellers will come in so you  can just simply have volatility at  52-week highs it can sometimes indicate  that it could be a blue sky setup blue  sky is all-time Highs but it's not a  guarantee of that because of course  um Blue Sky can just be 52-week highs  can just be something that's at 52-week  Highs but has been selling off for like  10 years so it's not going to be a blue  sky setup in that case  uh there are some alert style scanners  for  the large cap room here so large cap has  high day momentum scanner as well  similar to the one that we have here  also has  um let's see  the reversal scanner right here so this  reversal scanner you can see we've got  PayPal on here so here we've got a  number of different types of alerts  we're looking at consecutive five minute  candles  bottom reversal candle outside Bollinger  Bands all of these indicate a stock  that's getting to extremes and could be  due for a reversal the more consecutive  candles you have usually I feel the  better so I like to see high number of  consecutive candles and then we look at  that for a possible reversal so PayPal  on the five minute is showing whatever  it was seven consecutive candles so  selling off here so this is the type of  setup that maybe you would look at for a  reversal coming back up you know maybe  yes maybe no  but depend of course on your strategy so  these are all reversal based top  reversals mean you're going to look too  short off the top bottom reversals mean  you're looking to buy off the low  so a number of reversal scanners here  with some slightly different filters to  try to help you find confirmation  looking for the most extreme reversal uh  examples the generally the more extreme  the better because this just helps give  you um that added confirmation so inside  the reversal scanner you've got several  scans and uh that can also be used in  combination with top RSI scanner for  those looking for reversals  okay so with that uh I think I've given  you a good walkthrough of the scanners  that are currently in production I hope  you found that helpful and as always  reach out with
