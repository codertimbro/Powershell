let me paint you a picture you just woke  up you brushed your teeth got your  coffee and now you're doing your morning  stock preparation spending hours  scrolling through tens if not hundreds  of different stocks trying to find that  one gem that'll make you profitable that  morning have you ever wondered if  there's a magical way to completely  filter out thousands of stocks so you  can only see the ones that fit your  exact requirements maybe you're only  looking for bounce plays maybe you're  looking for breakouts maybe you're  looking for gradual gainers sharp  gainers long shorts well lucky for you  there is a way and in this video i'm  gonna share with you my stock screener  settings that i use every morning before  i trade so i can filter out all the  noise and only go through stocks that  i'd be genuinely interested in this will  save you tons of time will give you a  better watch list and if you do it  correctly this in itself will make you a  more profitable trader well let's not  waste any time let's get straight into  it first things first you're gonna need  a screener there are tons of different  screeners out there but some are better  than others but for the most part  they're all the same if you don't have  one yet i definitely suggest getting one  if you're looking to get in day trading  seriously or even trading at all it's an  important tool to have in your arsenal  and can be the difference maker of you  making money or not i'll be using finviz  for these examples but most screeners  will do just fine i would normally be  using trading view scanner but trading  view scanner costs money and finvis is  free so i thought for you guys we should  be using finvis for these examples i'll  leave a link in the description alright  so i don't know what type of trader you  are you might be a riskier trader than  me you might be a more passive trader  everyone is going to be different that's  why i'm going to give you multiple  different presets that i use so we can  include all types of traders i guess  what i'm trying to say is don't feel  like you have to copy my settings for  verbatim change them to whatever trading  style fits you best it's important  rather than just copying my settings you  understand the thought process behind it  also make sure you watch this whole  video because i will be leaving multiple  different screener settings and one of  them is an absolute gem that works  wonders for me i'm also not going to be  explaining each and every setting and  why i'm using it because i have a bunch  of different presets and if i explained  each and every one of them this video  would be an hour long if you want more  information or have a question of why i  selected a specific setting ask it in  the comments and i'll try to answer all  right the first strategy we're going to  be doing is for stocks that we want to  buy and hold these aren't short-term  trades these aren't day trades they are  trades that we can be confident in and  not sell most of these charts should  look like this where they have steady  and consistent growth so you want to go  to finviz and then go to the screener  tab and this will take you to the  screener the first setting we want to  change is market cap we only want to be  looking at stocks with over a 50 million  market cap this will filter out any and  all penny stocks next we only want to  see stocks that are above the 20-day  moving average we want to see a beta  over 1.5 eps growth over the next five  years should be over 10  return on equity set to over 15 then we  want the current ratio over 1.5 another  cool thing about finvis is that you can  get more details about a specific filter  if you don't necessarily know what it  means so for example if you don't know  what current ratio is you can hover over  it and see that it's assets divided by  liabilities so if you're wondering why i  selected something just hover over it  and it'll explain what that specific  filter means as you can see after adding  all these filters we get a nice little  list of stocks now i should also mention  right now not all these stocks down here  are going to be good plays that's an  important concept to understand with  screeners you should treat them as  filters not absolute trades this should  be used just as a simplified list so you  don't have to look at 6 000 different  stocks what i normally would do is take  this list go through each and every  chart look up the company if i don't  know it already and see if i like it if  i do i'll enter a position so as you can  see with all these settings most of them  are slow and steady gainers going up you  can also see that we have 18 stocks in  this list maybe that's too big of a list  for you well you can simply make your  settings more extreme so instead of  having an eps of 10 you can set it to 20  now you can see we only have 12 stocks  to look at that's the cool thing about  screeners you can customize them to  whatever your needs are you can also  select which data you want to look at so  maybe you want to see the stock's  performance well you can just click this  tab to do so so you can get some really  good information with these tabs you can  also hover over the stock's ticker and  it'll show you a quick example of what  the chart looks like so you don't have  to sit here and open each and every one  on trading view so what i normally do is  i hover over each and every one to see  if i like the general style of the chart  then i'll open it up on trading view to  do some more in-depth technical analysis  the next preset we'll be looking at is  for oversold bounce plays here's the  strategy for this one we're looking for  stocks that probably dropped too much  and the market just overreacted so what  we want are plays like this where  there's a recent drop and the price is  starting to correct itself so we can  enter or at least watch for a bounce  play these are usually really nice  because bounce plays usually make big  movers and big movers bring in a lot of  profit and most of the time you're  getting the stock for a pretty good  price so for this we want the stock  price to be over five dollars we then  want the rsi to be oversold and this  will give us only stocks that the market  probably overreacted on next we want to  set the change to up saying that it  recently just started going back up then  we want to set the relative volume to  over 2 which is basically saying that we  want to see stocks that have two times  the volume it usually does so with these  settings we're looking for oversold  stocks that are recently going up and a  lot more people are entering than usual  we got a nice set of stocks where if we  go through them almost all of them just  recently went down and are starting to  correct a bit one recommendation i would  have with this style of trading is to be  a little patient you don't want to catch  a falling knife not all these will  bounce back up some of them will act  like they want to correct but then just  keep falling so i'd suggest just putting  these on a watch list watch them for a  bit wait for some confirmation then  enter you can make some really good  plays with this preset this next preset  is looking for breakouts breakouts can  be really nice because once they are  confirmed most of the time they  skyrocket it's a really nice list to  have just to watch every now and then  for a potentially good gainer what we  are looking for are stocks like these  where it just now got to a new high and  is ready to keep going so for this  strategy we want the chart to be in a  strong uptrend to make sure we're  getting that we want the price to be  above the 20-day 50-day and 200-day  moving average next we want the stock to  be at a new high from the past 50 days  we also want return on equity to be over  20  this is just saying that we want the  company to be investing shareholders  money efficiently we also want the debt  to equity ratio under one so we know the  company doesn't have a lot of debt and  liabilities the final setting we want is  the average volume set to over a hundred  k so we know this stock is seeing some  interest from people and is pretty  liquid you should get charts that look  like this going up and creating new  50-day highs the play for these is just  to watch them for a bit maybe see if  they're breaking a key resistance and  giving some confirmation and then you  can enter again not all of these are  winners it's up to you to decide which  charts look good maybe you're a short  trader and don't like trading along that  often well these next settings are for  you these are short plays most of the  charts will look like this price with a  downward movement the first setting we  want to change is market cap we only  want to look at stocks over 300 million  we want the float short set to high at  20 percent this is basically saying  there are a lot of other short traders  shorting these stocks at the moment next  we want an average volume of over 500k  saying that we want a big downwards  movement and a lot of traders entering  giving us liquidity to exit the trade  whenever we want then we want a relative  volume over one so saying we want a  volume higher than what it normally is  then we want the current volume over  500k and boom you got a couple of stocks  that have some great potential to enter  a short position what's cool about this  one is the float setting so when  entering this trade you can be confident  there are others hopping on the same  exact strategy you're doing the next  preset we'll be taking a look at is  bounce plays off moving averages so it  should look something like this where  price came down and is looking to bounce  off the moving average using it as a  support and it's heading upwards to do  this we want a price to be above the  20-day moving average but we also want  the price to be below the 50-day moving  average then we want an average volume  of over 400k telling us this stock has a  lot of activity and then we want the  relative volume over one telling us it's  higher than normal then we want a  current volume of over 2 million as you  can see it gave us a lot of different  charts that went down recently but are  looking to bounce off the moving average  and to start heading upwards the next  preset is for all my dividend traders  out there we'll be trying to find  undervalued stocks that are looking to  grow but they also pay dividends first  things first we want large market cap  stocks so we'll set it to over 10  billion next we want a positive dividend  yield of over zero percent telling us  all these stocks pay dividends next we  want a p e ratio of under 20 saying it's  potentially undervalued then we won an  eps growth for the next five years at  over five percent telling us the company  is growing we want a payout ratio of  under 50 percent we want a low peg  giving us stocks that are undervalued  then we want an eps growth next year of  over five percent it's going to give you  a nice list a lot of these charts will  look different some will be going up  some will be going down it's just  important to realize that with these  settings we're looking for undervalued  stocks that have growth and pay  dividends this next and final preset is  going to be showing you companies with  insane growth and earnings all these  companies will most likely be a really  good buy we want to be trading with the  trend on this one so we want the price  to be above the 200-day moving average  we also want an average volume of over  400k telling us there's a lot of  activity we then won an eps growth for  the year to be over 25 we also want it  to be over 25 for the quarter and the  next year then we also want sales for  the quarter to be over 25  this in itself will give us some really  strong companies then we want companies  that are not oversold with an rsi over  50. and there you go it's going to give  you some strong companies with great  earnings recently which most of the time  means they're going to be doing really  good if you got absolutely any value  from this video i'd really appreciate it  if you took five seconds out of your day  and liked it maybe you need a trading  strategy to know when to enter or exit  some of these stocks well try this one  out where i made a hundred and thirty  percent profit within just two months of  trading thanks for watching and i'll see  you guys next time
