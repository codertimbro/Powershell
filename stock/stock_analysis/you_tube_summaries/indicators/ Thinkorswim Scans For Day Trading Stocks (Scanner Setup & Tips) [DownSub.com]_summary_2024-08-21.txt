hey what's going on everyone thanks for  checking out this video this is travis  from master the market  and i wanted to make a quick video to  talk a little bit about scanning for day  trading setups  here in the thinkorswim platform with td  ameritrade  so before we get into the scans  themselves i want to say that even  though i'm using thinkorswim  pretty much any scanner is going to have  similar criteria that you can plug in so  if you're using something like etrade  pro or you know  a paid option like trade ideas or equity  feed  or really anything along those lines  you're going to be able to apply pretty  much the same criteria  and set up the same custom scans with  those as well  so first and foremost what you do to  create a scan in thinkorswim  is go up here to the scan tab and from  there what you're going to want to do is  click on this little icon here  followed by load and create scan query  and after that all you're going to have  to do is put in the criteria that i'm  going to show you here in just a moment  and this is already a scanner that i  have created so i'm going to go ahead  and load this up  and the first one that i want to talk  about is a low float scanner so this is  looking for stocks that have a limited  amount of shares  to actually trade and you can think of  that as the supply for the stock  and you can think of the volume as the  demand and stocks with a low supply or  in other words a low amount of shares  available to be traded in a high amount  of volume or a high amount of demand  are going to be the stocks that have the  biggest potential for a huge run so  anytime you see a stock that's spiking  up  you know maybe 100 or 200 percent even  500  or more in a short period of time  whether that be one day or you know a  couple days or even a week  more often than not those are going to  be stocks that have a low number of  outstanding shares  because in its simplest form what that  is is a low amount of supply  so really all this scan is looking for  is first anything in the 1 to  20 dollars per share range now this is  completely preference honestly  i like to trade stocks in this range uh  but if you prefer to trade stocks maybe  below one dollar per share  or if you're somebody that trades higher  price stocks and you want to focus on  twenty dollars and up  you can of course change these settings  to fit your personal preferences  uh but after that you're going to want  to put in volume and you want the  minimum volume to be at least 100  000 shares and in my opinion this should  be pretty much the bare minimum  because anything below 100 000 shares is  going to be a very limited amount of  liquidity  and that's going to cause a lot of  problems with your trading because  as you know there has to be somebody on  the other side of your trade  so when you buy there has to be somebody  to sell you those shares  and vice versa when you sell there has  to be somebody to buy those shares from  you  and when there's a very small amount of  volume in a specific stock  more often than not you're going to have  trouble finding somebody on the other  side of the trade  so 100 000 shares is the bare minimum  and to be a little bit more picky you  can even boost this up to  you know 200 000 shares or even up to  500  000 or more shares now the next thing is  going to be the number of shares and  again this is going back to the supply  for the stock  we want this to be a pretty low amount  of supply because we want to look for  stocks with a lot of volatility  and the ones that have the biggest  potential for a huge spike in the near  future  so because of that i like to put the  maximum amount of shares outstanding  at 20 million shares anything below that  is going to be considered pretty low  and again these are the ones with  potential for a lot of volatility  in the fourth and final study that we  have down here we're looking for unusual  volume so we want the current day's  volume  to be at least 50 percent greater than  what it typically is  over the past 30 periods and you can go  ahead and select any period so  you know if you want to look over the  past 30 minutes you would have 30  periods selected but the period is  representing one minute  um you can also have 30 periods selected  but that can be  35 minute periods but in this case we're  looking for  volume to be at least 50 percent greater  than it is for an entire day  over the past 30 periods so now not only  are we looking for stocks with a limited  amount of shares in a limited supply  but we're also looking for stocks that  are trading unusually large volume  and more often than not these are two  things that you're going to see with  pretty much every single big  runner in the stock market so if we go  ahead then and click on scan  you can see that we get our list of  stocks meeting this criteria  and from there you would obviously want  to narrow this down a little bit further  and maybe look for stocks that have some  kind of news or press release  or some kind of upcoming news or press  release and then potentially look to  take a trade based off of that  okay so the other scan that i want to  talk about is a very simple one  and this is actually going to be pretty  much just my idea of a top percent  gainer scan  with just a few tweaks because i like to  be a little bit more specific with my  scans than just a general  top percent gainers so in this case i  have stocks anywhere between 10 cents  per share  all the way up to actually no maximum so  anything  above 10 cents per share is going to fit  into this scanner now  because we're looking for stocks that  are spiking up and they already have  some kind of gain i'm gonna go ahead and  boost this minimum percent change  up to just two percent i'm going to show  you how to actually arrange these so  that way you're looking at the biggest  gainers  but then the last thing that we have  down here is just volume again at a  minimum of 100 000 shares  and all you have to do then is click on  scan again and this is going to give you  the largest percent gainers now the way  that you have this listed from the top  percent gainers down  is just make sure that you click on  percent change up here at the top  um and it's going to maybe first list  them as the smallest gainers up to the  largest gainers but you want to have the  largest gainers up at the top  so if you click on that again it's going  to do just that  and again this is pretty much just a top  percent gainer scan  just in this case we're looking for a  minimum amount of shares  so that's going to remove the stocks  that are only trading a couple thousand  shares here and there  and also because i'm a little bit picky  and i don't want to trade stocks below  10 cents per share  it's also factoring that in and removing  those stocks from the scan  and believe it or not these two very  simple scanners are pretty much the only  ones that i use for my  intraday scanning for the most part i  trade a lot of stocks that are here on  the top percent gainers list  because these are stocks that more often  than not have some kind of news or press  release that was very recently released  on top of that they usually have a lot  of volume which is associated with that  news or press release  and they also have a lot of volatility  and generally speaking when it comes to  day trading the two things that you want  to see  are volatility and volume so now that we  have the scans themselves covered i want  to actually give you a few tips to  actually use this sidebar over here  so that way you can look at your scans  in real time while you're doing your  trading and while you're analyzing  charts without having to switch back  between  you know the trade tab and the chart tab  as well as the scan tab that we're on  right now  so one thing that many people don't know  is that over here on the sidebar  you can click on this plus button down  here to actually add a watch list  and in that watch list it's going to  have a default watch list saved in there  but you can actually add in any of your  scanners that you created and saved  right here on the scan tab so what  you're going to want to do is click on  this default scanner that it has pulled  up  and from there you're going to go to  personal and anything under personal  is a scanner that you created on your  own and saved  so just a reminder to actually save this  scanner after you put in this criteria  um and all you have to do is click on  the same button up here that you clicked  on to make the scanner in the first  place  and then go ahead and save that so that  way you're not going to have to put in  this criteria  every time you open the platform back up  and on top of that  it's going to be saved so that way you  can open it up over here on the sidebar  and it's going to show up under personal  uh so for example if we go ahead and  take this top percent gainers one that  we just talked about a moment ago  and you can see that now we have this  pulled up over here on the sidebar  now one thing that i don't like by  default about these scanners and watch  lists over here on the sidebar is the  way that they're arranged so i'm going  to click on this little settings icon  to the right of the ask and i'm going to  go ahead and customize this  now i personally like to focus on the  percent change rather than the net  change  so i'm going to go ahead and remove that  as well as the bid  and the ask and instead i'm going to go  ahead and add the  percent change as well as the volume  and then i'm going to go ahead and click  on ok and you can see that now our  scanner  is going to show us the symbol it's  going to show us the last price that the  stock traded at  it's going to show us the percent change  and last but not least it's going to  show us the volume over here  so again this is very useful if you are  you know doing some trading or chart  analysis  and you want to keep an eye on your  scanners at the same time without having  to switch between these two tabs  now another really cool thing is that  you can actually go ahead and widen this  sidebar out a bit  you can actually link all of these  different tools together  which is really going to help you save a  lot of time when doing your analysis  and when looking for some trade setup so  if we go ahead and set these all to  yellow or number two under this little  link feature on these tools  now anytime a stock pops up on our watch  list or on our scanner  if we click on that stock you can see  it's also going to pull up a quick chart  and it's also going to pull up the most  recent news for that stock  so if you wanted to read the news and  see what is causing the stock to spike  up  you just click on it and it's going to  have that article right there pop  up for you to read so the last thing  that i want to talk about is a way for  you to actually narrow down  the stocks that are pulling up on your  scanners to a much smaller list that  you're going to be able to put a little  bit more of your attention into  uh so to narrow that down even further  you can go ahead over here to the  sidebar  and add in another watch list and this  time we're going to go ahead on default  and create watch list  and just go ahead and give it any kind  of name i'm going to go ahead and call  this november  2nd watch list and all you have to do is  add in any symbols that were popping up  on your scanner that you think are going  to be a potential day trade in the near  future so  uh we'll just take this example here sup  uh we'll take e i g i  we'll add dgly  and let's take acor and then go ahead  and click on save  and again just like we did up here you  can also adjust the columns to have the  last price the percent change  and the volume instead of the net change  the bid and the ask  and now not only do you have your  scanners over here on the sidebar but  you have a more narrowed down list  of the best stocks that are actually  hitting that scanner and for me i think  that's a really great way to kind of  narrow down your scans  and to have a readily available list of  the stocks that you're looking to trade  so anyway i hope you found this video  helpful and let me know if you try out  these scans  and how they work out for you if you're  interested in learning how to day trade  swing trade or even long term invest  you can find more information on that at  my website master the market  which
