in this video i'm revealing the best
strategy that you can use
with the macd indicator so without
further ado
let's get on with the video
the moving average convergence
divergence or also known as the macd
is one of the most simplest and popular
indicator used by traders
essentially it is a trend following
indicator that shows the relationship
between two moving averages
so first let's apply it onto our chart
so you want to go to the indicator
section
type in macd and click the one on top
now before we start we first need to
know how does the macd work
so we can see here there are four
components to the macd
first we have these two lines the macd
line and the signal line
notice the difference between the two
the macd line moves faster and is more
sensitive to price changes
which will be the main focus of the macd
indicator
compare that to the signal line which
reacts slower to price changes
therefore giving it a more smoother
appearance
next we have the histogram which
represents the difference between the
macd line and the signal line
for example if the line crosses above
the signal line
the histogram will turn green and if it
crosses below
the histogram will turn red the gap
between the macd line and the signal
line
also affects the size of the histogram
as you can see
if the two lines are further apart the
histogram gets bigger
and if the two lines get closer the
histogram becomes smaller
and finally we have the zero line which
simply represents the center of the macd
indicator
now the way traders utilize this
indicator to identify momentum
is by looking at the crossover between
the macd line and the signal line
let me show you an example if the macd
line crosses above the signal line
it indicates that the market is on an
upwards momentum
and if it crosses below it indicates
that the market is only downwards
momentum
traders can also utilize the size of the
histogram to determine the strength of
the momentum itself
if the macd crosses above the signal
line while the histogram is getting
larger
it shows us that the upwards momentum is
getting stronger
similarly if the histogram is getting
smaller in size
it indicates that the upwards momentum
is getting weaker
now we've already established that the
macd is based on moving averages
and so the question is why should you
use the macd
and not the moving average well let me
give you a quick comparison
so here we have the macd that is set to
default settings
12 and 26 and over here we also have two
exponential moving averages
which are set to the same values as the
macd which are 12 and 26.
notice the correlation between the two
indicators every time we have a
crossover on the moving averages
we also have a crossover on the macd but
it's between the macd line and the zero
line
but remember what we look for in the
macd is not the zero line
but rather the crossover between the
macd line and the signal line
and so as you can see the crossover on
the macd
gave a much earlier entry signal
compared to the crossover on the moving
average
that's why i prefer it as my momentum
indicator
now let's talk about the different
strategies that you can use with the
macd indicator
so first a common mistake that traders
make is that they're using the indicator
by itself
let me show you why it's a bad idea to
use the macd alone
so here we can see that the overall
market is only downtrend
however the macd is crossing over
upwards
so notice how the signals are
contradicting the macd is indicating a
bullish momentum
but the market is only downtrend this is
exactly why you shouldn't use the macd
by itself
because what the macd is showing us is
only the short term momentum
and as traders we also need to take the
long term trend into consideration
because we never want to trade against a
trend and so
a simple but high win rate strategy that
i recommend for beginners
is by combining the macd with a long
term trend indicator
like the 100 ema this way we can safely
trade the macd while making sure that
we're staying within the same direction
of the long-term trend so this is how
you trade the strategy
the first step is you want to identify
the long-term trend
by looking at the 100 ema if the
price is above the 100 ema it indicates
that the long term trend is up
and if the price is below the 100 ema it
indicates that the long term trend is
down
so once you've identified the trend the
next step is we want to look for
crossovers on the macd
that shows the same signal as the long
term trend
so in this particular example we can see
that the long term trend
is up meaning we only take signals when
the macd crosses over upwards
and so here's where you want to take a
long position now for your exit strategy
you can place your stop loss at the
nearest swing low and set your profit
target at 1.5 times your stop loss
and as you can see
this trade ended up being profitable so
let's look at another example
in this chart we can see that the price
is below the 100 ema
indicating that the long term trend is
down next
we have a cross down on the macd and so
this will be our entry signal to go
short
now for your stop loss place it above
the nearest swing high
and set your profit target at 1.5 times
your stop loss
and as you can see the price hits our
profit target and so this counts as a
successful trade
so that was a simple macd strategy for
beginners that you can use
now for advanced traders if you want to
get more profits using the macd
you cannot simply rely on beginner
crossover techniques
because remember crossovers tend to work
only on trending markets
if the market is on a range like this
the indicator will give you many false
signals
so that is why if you want to increase
the win rate i recommend using a more
advanced version of the strategy
which is by combining the macd with
price action
so here's how the strategy works
the first step is we need to choose a
time frame
in this case i'm using the four hour
time frame
now the next thing you need to do is
identify a key level
within this time frame so as you can see
the price went up
hit and reverses downwards and so we can
draw a resistance line up here
the next step is you want to wait for
the price to approach the same key level
once again
now once this happens we are expecting
the price to reverse downwards
however just because the price touches a
key level
doesn't guarantee that a reversal will
happen because
key levels aren't magic prices can
always break right through
and that is why we need to use extra
confirmation to make sure that there is
actual downwards momentum
as price touches this area which is
where the mac the indicator comes into
play
now what most traders will do is that
they'll actually wait for the macd to
cross over
downwards before taking a short position
however
by doing this notice that the downwards
movement has already been made
and you would have entered in late
and so a secret trick that i used to get
an earlier entry signal
is by zooming in two time frames below
so i'm currently in the four hour chart
so let's zoom in into the two hour chart
so here's the two hour chart and all we
need to do
is wait for the macd to cross over
downwards in this new smaller time frame
and so this is where you want to take a
short position
so now let's go back to the 4 hour chart
and compare the two entry signals
so now we're back at the 4 hour time
frame and notice
if you would have used the crossover
from the two hour time frame
you would have entered in the trade here
but if you would have used the crossover
from the four hour time frame
you would have entered in here and even
though both trades ended up being
profitable
the smaller time frame crossover still
gave us an earlier entry signal
so let's look at the strategy one more
time
so here's the poundian on the two hour
time frame and over to the left
we can see that prices went down hit and
reverses upwards
making this a key support level now as
prices went back to this level again
we want to confirm that there's actual
upwards momentum as
price touches this area so again you
want to zoom in two time frames below
and apply the macd indicator so now
all we need to do is use the macd to
confirm the bullish momentum
by waiting for it to cross over upwards
once this happens
you take a long position now let's go
back to the two hour time frame
and apply our exit strategy so for our
stop loss
you can place it at the key level and
set your profit target at 1.5 times your
stop loss
and as you can see this trade
ended up being profitable so
