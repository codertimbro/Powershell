hey i tested the macd indicator 100
times
watch the full video to see the results
so if you're a beginner trader i'm sure
you've watched at least one trading guru
that tells you about how great the macd
indicator is
all these guru does is tell you all
about the strategies that you can
implement in the macd indicator
but have you ever watched like a full 30
minute training video
and walk out still not knowing crap but
because you just watched a long video
your brain kind of tricks you into
thinking that you actually learned
something and you thought you did
something productive with those 30
minutes but in reality you had no idea
what the guy just said
yeah that's called some cost fallacy and
it's bad
but don't worry we've all been there so
instead of bull crapping about how great
the macd
indicator is i'm just going to reveal to
you the approximate win rate of the
indicator
so you don't have to waste your precious
time and money testing it yourself
let me do all that for you
so first there are two methods that i'm
gonna be testing with the macd indicator
so the first method is i'm gonna call it
the normal method which is just your
normal way of using the macd
the second is i'm gonna call it the new
method
this method still uses the macd
indicator but in a very different way
some say that this second method
actually gives a higher win rate
let's see
so let me give a quick explanation just
in case some of you don't know how the
macd works
there are four components in the macd
this blue line
is called the macd line this line moves
faster
and is more sensitive to price action
which will be the main focus of the macd
indicator
this orange line is called the signal
line this line reacts slower to price
changes and is used to show the
direction of a trend
less sensitive it is mainly used to
filter out market noises
next we have the macd histogram it
simply represents the difference between
the signal line
and the macd line you can see that if
the two lines are further apart
the histogram gets longer and if the two
lines are closer
the histogram gets shorter next we have
the baseline
which just shows the middle area of the
mat the indicator
when the two lines are above the
baseline it indicates a bullish
sentiment meaning that the market is
uptrending
and when it is below the baseline it
indicates a bearish momentum
or a downtrend so now that you know the
parts of the macd
i'm gonna explain to you how you use the
macd like i said in the start of the
video
there are two methods that i'm gonna
back test so the first method
is called the normal method this is
simply how most people use the macd
indicator
so quick summary there are two lines
it can be either above or below the
baseline
if the two lines are below the baseline
and the macd line crosses above the
signal line
you go long and if the two lines are
above the baseline and it crosses below
the signal line
you go short pretty simple
now for the new method this is a
different way of utilizing the macd
the lines can be either above or below
the baseline
if the lines are below the baseline you
wait for it to cross downwards again
then you take a short position
[Music]
so after the lines crosses upwards
wait for it to cross downwards again
while still being below the baseline
that's when you take your short position
it's the same example with the long
position when the lines are above the
baseline
and it crosses upwards again while still
being above the baseline
you take a long position
for the normal method it focuses on
spotting reversals
as the lines are below the baseline when
you go long
however the new method focuses on trend
continuations
as you enter a long position when the
lines are already above the baseline
for my exit strategy since we are solely
testing the macd indicator
that means i will also use the macd
indicator as my exit strategy
my exit strategy would be the same for
those two methods
every time the macd line and the signal
line crosses over
i exit my trade it doesn't matter if
it's above or below the baseline
if it crosses over at any point i close
the trade
there are a couple of rules that i use
when back testing an indicator
the first rule is measuring at a
candle's close
what do i mean by this well indicators
collects data from the candle itself
so if the candle is still moving the
indicator would also be
moving
that is why it is important to start
measuring from a candle's close
for example here we have a chart let's
say i'm testing the normal method
so i'll start measuring here
because it's a green candle so the close
is in the top part of the body
so i'll start here and let's say just an
example that our exit signal is here
and it happens to be a red candle a red
candle
closes at the bottom of the candle's
body so the measurement would be from
this point
to this point
the next rule is that if my entry signal
appears
immediately after my exit signal i'm
going to enter at the next candle
so what do i mean by this because our
exit strategy is waiting for the macd to
cross over
there are often times where the macd
displays an entry signal
right after it displays an exit signal
as shown here
so if this happens i'll start measuring
at the next candle's close
i'm gonna be using the euro usd 15
minute chart for this back test
so here's an excel sheet that i created
to record this back
test here i can insert how much wins and
loss i already got
and it would automatically calculate the
win rate
so i'll consider a win if i make a
profit
it does not matter how much pips i got
if i got a profit i'll consider it a win
however if i get a loss or a break even
i'm counting it as a loss
this back test i'm going to start with a
capital of ten thousand dollars
and every trade i'm using 150 times
leverage
but i'm only trading with one percent of
my capital per trade
so that i would not blow up my account
this means that i would only risk
one percent of my capital per trade this
excel sheet also automatically counts
your new capital after you trade
so for example let's say i got three
pips from a trade
so i'll enter it here and it'll
automatically calculate how much profit
you got
what's your new capital and what is your
new trading budget because like i said
i'll only risk one percent of my capital
per trade
so this automatically calculates one
percent from my new
capital
bear in mind that these results are just
an approximate win rate because you
can't determine the exact win rate of
the strategy by only testing it 100
times
so after back testing these two types of
macd
indicators 100 times here are the
results
so for the normal method we have a 42
win rate with 42 wins and 58 losses
but even though the win rate is less
than 50
we still managed to come out profitable
we made a total of
ten dollars and thirteen cents or nine
pips from our ten thousand dollars
investment
now remember that we didn't manage our
losses and had a proper exit strategy
so if we had used a proper risk
management and a good exit strategy i'm
pretty sure we would come out more
profitable
we actually made 343 dollars at some
point
our biggest single trade win was 115
dollars and 42 cents
which was about 57 pips
however our biggest one trade loss
was 156 or 77
pips like i said had i used the correct
exit plan and a proper risk management
i could have avoided that huge loss and
exited that trade earlier
for the new macd method the second macd
strategy had a whopping
23 win rate which is very far compared
to the normal method
with 42 we lost a total of
75 cents which is about 46 pips using
this indicator
at some point we reached a profit of 138
and 33 cents our biggest
one trade profit was 59
and our biggest one trade loss was only
42 dollars
unlike the normal method where most
losses comes from
huge one trade losses this indicator's
losses
mostly comes from small yet continuous
losses
so i think even though if we use the
tight stop loss and the correct money
management
the results wouldn't be any better
either because the odds are simply
against us
the concept of the new method kinda
makes sense as it
tries to capture continuation trends
instead of reversals
yet the normal method does a much better
job of detecting continuation trends
while giving a good entry because in my
opinion the new method tries so hard to
capture continuation trends
meaning that the trend had already
happened it also displays a late signal
and it's not even a good entry
overall i think the macd does a really
good job of spotting early trends
of course trends on the market does not
always happen sometimes the market is
stagnant but the macd
rarely gives false signals for entry
especially when you combine it with a
good exit indicator
if you want me to backtest multiple
indicators
comment which indicators you want me to
backtest below
and remember the most important factor
to determine your success
is always money management because
trading is just a probability game
and finding which indicators has the
highest probability
would give you an edge and if you pair
that up with good money management
you will succeed at trading
and that's the end for me today
