possible
before we proceed to the trading rules
let's first understand what macd
indicator is
the moving average convergence
Divergence macd oscillator is a momentum
indicator designed to show the
relationship between two sets of moving
averages
the macd subtracts the long-term EMA
from the short-term EMA to produce an
indicator that reflects both Trend and
momentum the indicator consists of three
elements a macd line which measures the
distance between two moving averages the
signal line which identifies changes in
price momentum and the histogram which
represents the difference between the
macd and Signal line
when the macd line crosses the signal
Line This is an indication of a
short-term momentum change
when both of the lines cross the zero
level this usually indicates a shift in
a longer term trend
the next indicator we have on our chart
is called volume weighted average price
or vwap
this is a technical analysis indicator
used on intraday charts that resets at
the start of every new trading session
it's a trading Benchmark that represents
the average price of security has traded
it throughout the day based on both
volume and price
vwap is used in different ways by
Traders
Traders may use vwap as a trend
confirmation tool and build trading
rules around it
we will use vwap as a baseline for our
strategy
the third indicator of our strategy is
utbot alerts
this is a simple buy and sell indicator
that is based on the average true range
the average true range or ATR is an
indicator that measures Market
volatility
it's used in technical analysis and
shows how much an asset's price moves on
average during a given time frame
based on this information the indicator
finds the most optimal prices for
entering long and short trades
okay now that we know how these
indicators function let's break down the
exact conditions for buy and sell trades
so for a Buy Signal to be valid the
following must be met
first a buy label must be printed below
the price bar
second at the time the signal is issued
the price bar must be fully above the
vwap blue line
third the macd histogram should be
colored green
if the bar is light green you should not
enter the trade
lastly check the position of the most
recent bullish cross on the macd against
the zero level
the cross must occur above the middle
line
open a Buy trade at the close of the
current price bar if these rules are in
place
set the stop loss below the most recent
swing low
exit a winning long trade as soon as the
indicator prints a cell label
here are a couple more examples of by
trades
watch how the macd indicator filters out
false signals
here we see the Candlestick price is
above the v-wap
a Buy Signal was issued
the macd is green and the cross happened
above zero
Traders it's very critical to stick to
the strategy rules we just showed you
sometimes the risk reward ratio can be
really high
this is a major secret to making a lot
of money from Trading

all right now let's learn how to enter
short trades
first the indicator must issue a signal
to sell

if the bar is colored in light red the
signal is invalid

recent cross on the macd
the cross needs to be below the middle
level
if these conditions are present place an
order to sell at the close of the price
bar

swing high and exit a winning short
trade once you receive a signal to buy
if you follow these rules you'll be
amazed at how well this strategy works
so how exactly should you add these
indicators to the chart
well first log into trading View and
open the chart of any asset
then head over to the indicators menu
and search for the first tool which is
called moving average convergence
Divergence
you can find this indicator under
technicals
leave its settings on default
for the second tool search for volume
weighted average price
choose this indicator right here
its settings will also remain by default
finally for the third indicator add
utbot alerts
select this one that was created by
Quant nomad
access its settings and change the ATR
period to 5.
that's it the strategy is ready
in order to save your time you can
create alerts for these buy and sell
signals
the way you can do that is by clicking
on the alert button at the top and
selecting the utbot alerts indicator as
the condition
as for the signal you can choose buy
sell or even both
set the alert to occur once per bar
close
once you've finished click create
you will be notified every time the
indicator prints a signal
make sure to check if the rest of the
conditions are met before entering the

Bitcoin on the five minutes time frame

percent
