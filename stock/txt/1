data trader better macd 

hey Traders so here we have the macd
indicator as we all know it is one of
the most famous and oldest indicators
ever created and is widely used among
beginners
however what if I told you that there's
actually a newer version of this
indicator that is proven to be almost
three times more profitable than the
older version
and so without further Ado let's Dive
Right In I'm going to show you what the
indicator is and how it works
so first I'm sure all of us are familiar
with the mechanics of the classic macd
it helps us identify potential Trends by
displaying crossovers between two lines
if the Blue Line crosses above the
Orange Line it shows us that the market
is potentially uptrending and that it
would be a good buying opportunity
and if the Blue Line crosses below the
Orange Line it shows us that the market
is potentially downtrending and that it
would be a good selling opportunity
now this may seem like a good and simple
strategy however a common problem with
the strategy is that it only works on
trending markets and as we all know
markets aren't always trending it can
also move sideways or within a range
like this and because of that the Mac
the indicator would perform terribly
during this type of market like in this
example here
we can see that the macd is crossing
upwards which supposedly tells us that
an uptrend is coming however because the
market structure is moving sideways it
gave us a false signal and the market
did not go up as expected now over time
these false signals could accumulate and
slowly wipe out their profits and could
even bring your account towards the
negative
and so what if I told you that this new
version of the macd indicator could also
help us identify Trends however it could
also eliminate these fall signals for us
when the market is ranging therefore
minimizing your loss
and so that indicator is called the
impulse macd similar to the old macd the
impulse macd is also a momentum
indicator that could detect Trends
however it has its own unique feature
the difference is that unlike the normal
macd which displays multiple false
signals when the market is ranging
the impulse macd filters out these false
signals and goes completely flat as you
can see here and so because of this
unique feature you're now less likely to
get trapped by these fall signals and
now I'm going to show you exactly how to
apply this indicator onto your chart how
it works and the different strategies
that you can use
so the first thing you want to do is
apply the indicator onto your chart now
the charting platform that I'm using is
called tradingview.com once you've
opened it you want to go to the
indicator section type in impulse macd
and choose the one by a lazy bear
next once you've applied the impulse
macd we want to change the appearance of
the indicator so that it's simpler to
look at and to do that you go to
settings style and follow this exact
preset that I created
and as you can see the impulse macd now
looks much more organized now let's take
a look at each part of this indicator so
similar to the normal macd this
indicator also has four components first
we have this blue line called the
impulse macd line next we have this
Orange Line called the signal line
furthermore we have the histogram
and finally we have the middle line
now how do we use this indicator so very
similar to the normal macd the way we
identify Trends on the market is by
looking at the crossover between the
impulse macd line and the signal line
if the impulse Mac d-line crosses above
the signal line it indicates that the
momentum is going upwards and if the
impulse Mac d-line crosses below the
signal line it indicates that the
momentum is going downwards however if
the two lines go flat like this it
indicates that the market is ranging or
moving sideways and you should avoid
taking any positions now let's move on
to the different strategies that you can
use with this indicator
so this next strategy is a little bit
more advanced but it also has a higher
win rate it's called the impulse macd
extension and this is how you trade it
the first step is we need to manually
add overbought and oversold levels on
the indicator and so what you do is you
drag your mouse above the middle line of
the indicator and press alt h
or you can just add the lines manually
like this
and so this will be your overbought line
for your oversold line you do the exact
same thing but in the opposite value so
this time drag your mouse to below the
middle line and again press alt h
now you have your oversold line
so the reason we apply these overbought
and oversold levels to the indicator is
because we want to make sure that we
only take positions from crossovers that
happen outside of these overbought or
oversold levels because this means that
the price is overextended and prices
that are overextended will have a higher
chance of making significant moves
now you may be wondering how did I
determine the exact placement of these
lines
so here's how you do it
first let's start with identifying the
placement of our overbought line so
first you want to zoom out
now immediately we can see that there
are two types of crossovers that's
happening first are crossovers that
happen further from the middle line
which are called the major crossovers
next we also have the smaller crossovers
that are happening closer to the middle
line which are called the minor
crossovers
now what you want to do is separate the
major crossovers from the minor ones by
drawing a horizontal line
and so the minor crossover should be
contained below the line and the major
crossover should be contained above the
line again the reason for this is
because we only want to take positions
from these major Crossovers and ignore
the minor ones
and so this will be your overbought line
now for your oversold line you want to
place it and the opposite of your
overbought line so since your overbought
line is at this value I'm going to place
it at the negative of that value
and so this will be your overbought and
oversold levels
now keep in mind these values are not
fixed you can always adjust these lines
depending on the crossover placements
and also the different market conditions
so if you want to use this indicator on
another pair you would need to adjust
new overbought and oversold levels based
on the market conditions of that pair
now that your indicator is ready here's
how you treat the strategy
so first for your Buy Signal you want to
only take positions if the impulse macd
crosses over upwards but the crossover
needs to happen below the oversold line
similarly for your cell signal you only
take positions if the impulse macd
crosses over downwards but the crossover
needs to happen above the overbought
line
remember crossovers that happen between
the lines like this will be ignored this
is because we want to make sure that we
only take positions if the price is
overextended so let's look at a couple
of examples so in this setup we spotted
a crossover upwards on the macd while
the crossover is happening below the
overbought line indicating that the
price is on an upwards momentum while
being oversold and so this will be a
valid buy position
next for your risk management you can
set a stop loss below the nearest swing
low and a profit Target at one and a
half times your stop loss
and as you can see
this trade ended up being profitable
let's look at another example here we
spotted a crossover downwards on the
impulse macd however as you can see this
crossover happened inside the lines
meaning this signal will be ignored
because again you want to make sure that
the price is overextended
next
we spotted another crossover downwards
but this time it happened above the
overbought line meaning there's a
downwards momentum while the price is
overbought and so this will be a valid
sell signal now for your stop loss you
can set it at the nearest support level
and set your profit Target at one and a
half times your stop loss
and as you can see
this trade ended up being profitable now
moving on another Advanced strategy that
you can utilize with the impulse macd
indicator is by using it to hunt
breakouts
so first let's start with the definition
a breakout is when price makes a sudden
and significant move towards One
Direction and if you could take
advantage of these significant moves it
could result in a massive profit with
minimal risk
and so a common pattern that tends to
happen is that breakouts tend to form
after a long period of ranging or
sideways Market
and by using the impulse macd's ability
to identify these ranging markets we can
use it to our advantage and find
breakouts before they happen so here's
how you trade the strategy
the first step is finding a range market
and we can do that by waiting for the
impulse macd to go flat as shown here
however you also need to take into
consideration the length of the flatness
remember we only want to use signals
where the impulse macd goes flat for a
long period of time we do this to ensure
that we don't get a false signal because
the longer the market stays within range
the higher the chance that a breakout
would happen
now once you've identified the ranging
Market the next step is predicting the
direction of the breakout will it happen
to the upside or the downside
and so the way you do this is by looking
for signs of rising momentum as shown by
the histogram which are the bars that
you can see on The Middle
so let's look at an example of that
here we can see that the histogram is
currently flat
and after that
it slowly starts Rising towards the
upside as reflected by the price also
going upwards indicating that the
overall momentum is bullish which means
based on this example we can conclude
that the breakout will likely happen
towards the upside and so this is a good
opportunity to take a buy position next
you also need to make sure that your
risk management is on point now because
this is a breakout strategy it means
that it can have a high profit potential
while maintaining low risk which is why
for stop loss you can set it just
slightly below your entry position right
here and as for a profit Target you can
set it slightly higher a typical
breakout strategy usually has around a
three to one risk ratio and so you can
set it at three times the length of your
stop loss and as you can see
this trade ended up being profitable
and so I just revealed to you multiple
impulse macd trading strategies that you
can easily Implement and trade right now
