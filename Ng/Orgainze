Thanks for the additional details. I'll create a task organizer that can import CSV files with ticket number, caller ID, phone number, and date/time columns, plus allow you to add and remove tasks manually.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I've created a work task organizer that can:

1. Import CSV files with ticket numbers, caller IDs, phone numbers, and date/time information
2. Allow you to manually add new tasks with all required fields
3. Organize tasks chronologically by their scheduled time
4. Delete tasks when they're completed

**Key features:**

- **CSV Import**: Click the "Import CSV" button to upload your task data
- **Add Tasks Manually**: Create new tasks with ticket number, caller ID, phone number, date/time, and description
- **Time Organization**: All tasks are automatically sorted by date and time
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

The application intelligently handles different CSV column naming variations (like "ticket_number", "ticket number", or "ticketNumber") to make importing more flexible.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the code or make any adjustments to better suit your needs?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
